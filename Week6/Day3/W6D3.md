# Spring Data

### Spring data is not a core spring framework

Spring Data is a family of frameworks for ORM and data perstistence whos main purpose is to abstract away required logic for data storage. Allows us to focus on business logic

## Object Relational Mapping (ORM):

ORM's convert the data between relational databases and object oriented programming langauages

-   Essentially turn Java objects, into an entry in a database table for us

Most object-oriented application store data in relational databaes which use tables, while the application classes create objects, in order to get data from one to another we must do some conversion

Benefits of ORM's:

-   ORM's map an object to the table for you
-   we can hide the details of SQL queries from OO logic, this propagates the idea of data abstraction
-   it provides methods for automatic versioning and time stamping
-   it provides caching for better performance
-   best suited for large projects
-   injected transaction management
-   configurable logging
-   faster development of applications

There are lots of ORM's available, including Hibernate, JPA, Active JOA, iBATIS, IBM Pure Query and more

# Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA is Spring Data module that you can use to implement the Java Persistence API, aka JPA. This helps us implement our data layer exremely quickly, giving us implementations for our DAO functionality with simple method stubs.

## JPA and Hibernate

We are specifically using Spring Data JPA

It essentially abstracts away the use of hibernate and Spring ORM, simplifying you Data Access Layer and providing standard implementations for common DAO methods

## JPA

JPA is the Java Persistence API, and its the standard API for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects/classes and relational databases

You can find it in the javax.persistence package

-   It uses the Java Persistence Query Lanaguage which is an object oriented query language
-   It uses EntityManager: an interface to create, read, update, delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes

## Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM tool for Java programming

-   It is flexible and powerful ORM solution to map Java classes to database tables
-   It is an implementation or JPA, so it follows the standards provided by JPA
-   It is defined under the org.hibernate
-   It uses the Hibernate Query Language which is similar to JPQL
-   Hibernate session interface is an extension to JPA's EntityManager

We no longer have to implement our DAO methods, they are simply provided for you by extending the JpaRepositry

When you extend the JpaRepository Spring will automatically create an implementation of your DAO, include CRUD for standard data access, as well as custom queries based off of method signatures

## Spring Data JPA Features

-   Building sophisticated repositories based on Spring and JPA
-   Support for QueryDSL predicates and type safe JPA queries
    -   This is less important/probably wont use it. But, QueryDSL us a framework which enables statically typed SQL-like queries, instead of requiring inline queries XML
-   Transparent auditing of domain classes
-   Pagination support
-   Dynamic Query Execution
-   Support for integration of custom data access code
-   Automatic Custom Queries
-   Validation of @Query annotated queries during bootstrapping
-   Support for XML based entity mapping
-   JavaConfig based repository configuration by introducing `@EnableJpaRepository`

## Spring Data JPA Methods

Comes with predefined Methods

-   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html
-   Primarily CRUD operations

You can create custom method signature to find almost anything you want/need:

-   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html
-   Take a look at table 2.3 in the above link for examples
-   When Spring data create a new repository imnplemenation, it analyzes all of the methods in the interface, and attempts to automatically generate queries from the method names. It has its limitations but it is also very powerful and an elegant way of defining new custom access methods with very little effort

You can also use the @Query to write JPA queries and use QueryDSL like stated above

-   You may end up using @Query, but its typically rare

# Spring Data Annotations

A quick run down of the different Spring Data Annotations

| Annotation                      | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @Transactional                  | Configure how the database transaction behaves                                            |
| @NoRepositoryBean               | Creates an interface that provides common methods for child repositories                  |
| @Param                          | Parameters can be passed to queries defined with @Query                                   |
| @Transient                      | Mark a field as transient, to be ignored by the data store engine during reads and writes |
| @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy     | Auditing annotations that will automatically be filled with the current principal         |
| @CreatedDate, @LastModifiedDate | Auditing annotations that will automatically fill with current date                       |
| @Query                          | Supply a JPQL query for repository methods   

# @Transactional

When we are interacting with databases through Java, we should expect that multiple transactions will be performed simultaneously

With @Transactional we can allow Spring Data to manage these transactions for us to prevent issues with very little added code

It is best practice to use @Transactional on your @Service class, since this is where the actual querries occur

@Transactional essentially, makes Spring treat each method as a transaction, so if an exception, or error occurs in the middle of an method call, all of the actions taken in the method will be rolled back

We can mark entire classes, or individual methods

@ Transactional attributes
| Attribute | Purpose |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isolation | The transaction isolation level. |
| noRollbackFor | Defines zero (0) or more exception Classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback. |
| noRollbackForClassName | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable) indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback. |
| propagation | The transaction propagation type. |
| readOnly | A boolean flag that can be set to true if the transaction is effectively read-only, allowing for corresponding optimizations at runtime. |
| rollbackFor | Defines zero (0) or more exception classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback. |
| rollbackForClassName | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable), indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback. |
| timeout | The timeout for this transaction (in seconds). |
| transactionManager | A qualifier value for the specified transaction. |

# Transactional Propagation Strategies

When accessing Databases with Java, it is common that you may have one service method call apon anothe service method, these Transaction Propagation Strategies describe how spring should manage these situtations

|   Strategy    | Purpose                                                                                              |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Mandatory   | Support a current transaction, throw an exception if none exists.                                    |
|    Nested     | Execute within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists, behave like REQUIRED otherwise. |
|     Never     | Execute non-transactionally, throw an exception if a transaction exists.                             |
| Not Supported | Execute non-transactionally, suspend the current transaction if one exists.                          |
|   Required    | Support a current transaction, create a new one if none exists.                                      |
| Requires New  | Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.                         |
|   Supports    | Support a current transaction, execute non-transactionally if none exists.                           |

# ACID: Properties of Transactions

In SQL every transaction must abide by these four properties, these are known as the ACID properties

## Four properties of a transaction

Atomic: All or nothing, the transaction is fully complete, or it doesn't happen at all

Consistency: The tables schema shall remain itact after the transaction

Isolation: Each transaction shall not affect another transaction

Durabilty: Data will persist through system crashes and other issues
