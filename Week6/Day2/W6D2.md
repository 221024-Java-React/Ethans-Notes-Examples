# Spring Boot Introduction

Spring Boot is an open source Spring Framework project used to rapidly create Java based production grade applications utilizing Spring framewoeks IOC and module integrations

Spring Boot simplifies project creation because it allows you to pick and choose which Spring frameworks you want to use, and configures them for you

Spring Boot has a built in Tomcat server, and you dont need to map any servlets for web applications

To enable auto configuration you just need to annotate your driver class with @SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootApplication is a combination of:

-   @SpringBootConfiguration
-   @EnabledAutoConfiguration
-   @ComponentScan

You can also override/customize configurations using the application.properties file

# Lombok

Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. You will never have to write another getter, or equals method gain, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, automate your logging variables, and much more.

Lomboks goals is to reduce boilerplate code by generating it at runtime, this includes:

-   Getters and Setters
-   No Arg Constructors
-   toString methods
-   equals
-   hascode
-   logging variables

Instructions to install lombok

Download and the run the jar

Include lombok as a dependency in your project

# MVC Architecture Review

Model View Controller Design Pattern, it is a pattern that is used to design user interfaces and structure applications

Model: used to represent the business later of the application, aka the data layer which defines the business logic of the system, and represents the state of the application

View: the presentation layer/ui of the application. It displays data that is fetched from the model layer by the controller

Controller: the link between the view and the model, it receives user requests from the view, talks to the model layer, and returns data to display on the view.

The advantage of breaking up our application like this, is that multiple developers can be working on each independently of each other

It also enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together

# Spring Web/MVC

Spring MVC is a request driven structure centered around a central Servlet using the front controller design pattern

Servlets are the underlying technology that allows Java to interface between clients through the internet

## Front Controller Design Pattern

The front controller design pattern provides a single handler for all incoming requests for a resource in an application, then dispatches the requests to the appropriate secondary handler for that type of request.

It uses a helper api to achieve the dispatching mechanism, it is broken up into four differen components

Front controller is the single point of entry for requests, it directs requests to the dispatcher

Dispatcher is reposponsible for managing the actions and the views, including locating and routing to specific actions that will service a request, and finding the correct view

Helper classes are used to break up the logic of specific features, and makes the program easier to build and maintaine

Views represent and display information that we want to display to the client

The Spring DispatchServlet is completely integrated with the Spring IOC container

The Dispatch Servlet routes requests to handlers, view resolvers, and also provides support for uploading files

Since DispatchServlet is a servlet itself it must map it in the web.xml

View Resolvers will retrieve the correct view from controller

Since we did not learn servlets, we will use Spring Boot to configure spring mvc/web for us by including it when we create our project

# Spring MVC Annotations

## @Controller:

will mark the class as a controller, which is a special kind of spring bean that handles requests, the dispatcher will scan for these classes, and send requests to the correct controller

## @RequestMapping:

used to map a uri to a specific class, or to a specific method inside of a controller, you can also include the http method if it is over a method

## @RequestBody:

use this annotation to gain access to the object sent with the request

## @ResponseBody:

this annotation will automatically convert the return of the method to the correct json object to send in the response back to the client

## @RestController:

a class level annotation that combines @RequestMapping and @ResponseBody, allows you to return from the controller methods normally, without a ResponseBody annotation

We will be seeing these annotations again once we get into SpringBoot

## Path Paremeters and Query Parameters

Path Parameters and Query Parameters are ways to send information to the server without using a POST request, these should only be used to send information that is none confidential. To set these up you use the @RequestParam and @PathVariable in the method parameters

Path Variable allows you to add a value after the last slash of the request uri, ex `http://url/get/variable`

Query Parameters use a ? in the uri then you define the parameters you are sending over, ex `http:url/get?var=name`
