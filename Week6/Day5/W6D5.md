# Spring Boot Profiles / Dynamic Environment Configuration

Spring Boot profiles allow us to map beans to different profiles, such that we have different versions of beans, possibly for different environments

This might be useful, to have some production repository bean, that interacts with the production database
- Then you could have a dev repository bean which interacts with a dev database
- Then you could have a testing repository bean which interacts with some testing database

# Introduction to Integration Testing

In a software project, we have many different modules, in a team setting many of these will be implemented by different people.

We have already spoke about testing each one of these modules with unit testing, but the next step after unit testing is integration testing.

Integration testing is where we combine each of our modules/units into the whole system they are creating and testing that entire system

The purpose of this level is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated.

In Java we can use the same framework we were already using for unit tests to do integration testing JUnit

We will also make heavy use of Mockito to mock the dependencies in between all of the componentes that we are integration testing

# Spying with Mockito

Spying in Mockito allows you to watch specific methods of a class to be called, if they method you are spying on is called you can override the logic to that method

This is useful in testing, so you don't make calls to your database while testing your code
