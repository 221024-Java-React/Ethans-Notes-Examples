# Introduction to HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a client server protocol

It allows us to send information between clients and servers via HTTP messages using the TCP protocol

# HTTP Request/Response contents

HTTP Requests are the messages sent from the client to the server

They are composed of:

-   Verb: the HTTP method being executed
-   URI: the endpoint of the resource
-   HTTP Version
-   Request Header: contains metadata about the request
-   Request Body: the data that we are sending

HTTP Responses are the message that are sent back to client from the server

They are composed of:

-   Response/Status Code: information about the success or failure of the request
-   HTTP Version
-   Response Headers: contains metadata about the response
-   Response Body: any data being sent to the client from the server

# HTTP verbs

Two important characteristics of HTTP methods are if they are:

## Idempotent

identical requests can be made once or serveral times in a row and return the same result every time

## Safe

the request does not alter the sate of the server

The verbs of HTTP include

## GET

-   Used to retreive data
-   No request Body
-   sage
-   idempotent
-   cacheable
-   allowed in html forms

## HEAD

-   Essentially the same as GET, but the servers response should not include a body
-   Used to retrieve data
-   No request body
-   safe
-   idempotent
-   cacheable
-   NOT allowed in html forms
-   NO reponse body

## POST

-   sends data to the server
-   will often be used to create of update data
-   it is not idempotent or safe
-   technically, but really cacheable
-   allowed in html forms
-   request and response body

## PUT

-   used to update a target resource such that it replaces the current representation with the one included in the PUT request
-   is idempotent
-   not safe
-   not cacheable
-   not allowed in html forms
-   response does not have a body
-   request does have a body

## DELETE

-   used to delete a resource
-   might have a request and or response body
-   not safe
-   not cacheable
-   not allowed in html forms
-   is idempotent

## CONNECT

-   starts a "tunnel"-- two-way communication with the resource
-   No request body
-   Recieves a response body
-   **NOT** safe, idempotent, cacheable, or supported by html forms

## OPTIONS

-   Get the options for communication with a particular resource
-   safe, idempotent
-   request has no body
-   response has a body
-   Not cacheable or available in html forms

## TRACE

-   message loop-back test between client and resource
-   useful for debugging
-   no request body or response body
-   not safe, cacheable, or allowed in html forms
-   idempotent

## PATCH

-   similar to update
-   changes partial aspects of a resource
-   request and response have a body
-   **NOT** safe, idempotent, allowed in html forms, or cacheable

# HTTP Status Codes

Status Code gives us information about our request

Informational Responses: 100-199

Successful Responses: 200-299

-   200 OK
-   201 Created
-   202 Accepted

Redirects: 300-399

-   300 Multiple Choices
-   301 Moved Permanently
-   302 Found

Client Errors: 400-499

-   401 Unauthorized
-   403 Forbidden
-   404 Not Found

Server Errors: 500-519

-   500 Internal Server Error
-   503 Service Unvailable

# Introduction to Javalin

Javalin is a lightweight Web framework for Java and Kotline

It allows us to create a webservice without physicalling having to touch Servlets

-   Servlets are the underlying technology used in conjuction with Java to handle HTTP Requests, and send HTTP Responses

Javalin runs on an embedded Jetty Server, so we don't have to fumble around with configuring our own Tomcat servers

You will see a heavy use of lambdas to use Javalin, so get prepared

To use Javalin you will need to add the necessary jars to our class path

-   Javalin
-   slf4j
-   Jackson

Then to get started you just need to create a new Javalin object in the main method with any configuration you would like

```java
    Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> {})
    app.start(portNum)
```

Then you can start exposing endpoints and setting up your API implemenations

# HTTP Handlers:

the handler is a (functional) interface that should take in a Context Object as a parameter

-   The Context Object is an abstraction of the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects

To setup a hander, you simple use dot and whatever HTTP method you want on the server variable you set early.

-   Inside that method you include the path/endpoint that you want to expose to the enduser
-   And the function to handle the api call

Examples of setting up handlers in different ways:

```java
    app.get("path", <lambda expression>)
    app.get("path", (ctx) -> {how to handle this endpoint});
    app.get("path", implementation);
    app.post("path", <lambda>);
    app.routes( () -> {
			path("movies", () -> {
				get(MovieController.getMovie);
				post(MovieController.addMovie);
			});
	});
```

# Serialization via Jackson

The Jackson API is used to convery Java objects into JSON format to send in an HTTP response, and to convert the JSON sent from HTTP requests back into Java objects

Use ObjectMapper.writeValue() method to convert from Java to JSON

Use ObjectMapper.readValue() method to convert from JSON to Java

## JSON Javascript Object Notation

JSON is a data exchange format that is easily read by humans and computers

String format that represents objects in key value pairs

Syntax:

```json
{
    "key": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
```
- {} represent an object
- Key: the fields of the object
- Values: the fields values
- [{},{},{}] arrays to send multiple objects

## Why JSON
1. This makes nice and easy for our frontend to convert the objects
2. Our api's are going to be consumed by a client application (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
3. Javascript is virtually the ONLY viable option for a power, popular Client Side Programming

# PostMan

Postman is a very useful application that allows us to send HTTP Requests to servers, and nicely view the HTTP responses sent back

We will be using to manually test our API endpoints, and you will be using it to show the functionality of your P0

It is highly recommended to get very familiar with this tool and all of its features moving forward, because you will be using it a lot

# Overview of logging

Logging records events that occur during the execution of your program

-   They allow for developers to access information about applications which we do not have direct access
-   Without logs developers would have no idea what went wrong when the application crashes

We will be using Logback for logging:

- Logback is a successor of the older logging library log4j
- It is an implementation of the slf4j logging interface, so we will need also include that package

Logback allows us to use various logging levels, and configurable thresholds that determine which messages will be recorded in the application log files

Logback Logging Levels:

1. ALL => all levels
2. DEBUG => designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application
3. INFO => informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at the coarse grained level
4. WARN => designates potentially harmful situations
5. ERROR => designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running
6. FATAL => severe error events that presumably lead the application to abort
7. OFF => highest possible level, intended to turn off logging

## Setting Logging Threshold

We use configuration file called logback.xml in our java/resources folder

To set the logging level, you set the level attribute of the root tag to which ever level you like
