# Data structure:

a data organization, management, and storage format that enables effiecient access and modification

-   Each one prioritizes access and modification in different
-   Typically one is better for specific tasks for others

There are two different types of data structures:

-   Linear: arranged in an orderly manner where each element is attached adjacently
    -   Elements can ve access in one time single run
    -   Simplier to implement
    -   single level
    -   Memory inefficient
-   Hierarchical: arranges elements in a sorted order, adn there is a relationship between them
    -   Cannot be accessed in a single run
    -   Complex to implement
    -   Multi-leveled
    -   Memory Efficient

Java implements many of the linear structures in the Collection API

# Collection Framework

The Collection API is a framework of Java classes and interfaces that implement commonly used data structures

**ALMOST** every class in the collections api extends from the Iterable interface

-   Exception is the Map classes

# Iterable and Iterator Interface

## Iterable Interface:

defines data structures that can be directly traversed using the .iterator() method

## Interator Interface:

contains methods for traversing linear data structures, these methods include:

-   hasNext()
-   next()
-   remove()

Any class that implements Iterable can also be used with enhanced for-loops

Classes that implement the Iterable interface also have the .forEach() each method, which allows user to iterate through the data structure, and perform some logic with a lamda expression

# Generics

Generics are constructs introduced in Java 5 which enforce compile time type safety by allowing you to use parameterized types

-   They are used heavily with the Collections API

They are essentially a place holder for a future datatype that helps us enforce type safety

Generics can be declared on a class, method parameters, or return types

With Generics you can restrict a class to only accept objects of a given type and the compiler will prevent you from using any other types

To make a class or interface generic, use angled brackets when declaring it, and use an arbitrary "generic type" which is determined by invoking the code

Naming conventions for Generics

-   E => Element
-   K => Map Key
-   V => Map Value
-   N => Number
-   T => Generic Data type
-   S, U, V and so => For multiple generic data types

# Wrapper Classes

For every Primitive in Java, there is a wrapper class with the same name but capitalized

-   These allow you to treat primitives as objects

The Wrapper Classes include:

| Primitive | Wrapper Class |
| --------- | ------------- |
| boolean   | Boolean       |
| byte      | Byte          |
| short     | Short         |
| char      | Character     |
| int       | Integer       |
| long      | Long          |
| float     | Float         |
| double    | Double        |

Autoboxing: when you pass a primitive argument into a parameter that asks for its wrapper equivalent, Java will automatically wrap the primitive into its object type

Unboxing: when you pass a wrapper object into a parameter that asks for a primitive, Java will automatically convert the object to a primitive

# Lists

The most basic datatype, a collection of ordered data that is preserved

-   Duplicate entries are allowed
-   Elements are accessed by their index, which start at 0

ArrayList: a concrete implementation of the List interface that contains an array within it

-   The array is resizable, once it reaches the max capacity it increases its size by 50%
-   You can traverse it quickly via index
-   Insertion and deltion is slower, because it may have to resive the internal array

LinkedList: a concrete implementation of the List and Queue interface which is composed of nodes that reference each other

-   Insertion and deletion is relatively quick
-   Traverse to a specific index is slower

# Sets

A collection of data that is not ordered and does not allow duplicate elements

-   does not preserve the order in which elements are inserted

HashSet: a concrete implementation fo the Set interface backed by a HashMap

-   There is no ordering when iterating
-   Allows one null value
-   Allows fast insertion and traveral

TreeSet: a concerete implementation of the Set interface which maintains sorted order when elements are inserted

-   It is backed by a Sorted Tree
-   Insertion and deletion is slow
-   It cannot contain null elements

# Collections Demo

# Java Reading and writing to files

## Serialization:
the process of writing the state of an object to a byte stream, the reverse is called deserialization.
- We serialize Java Beans

## File I/O:

"I/O" refers to how data is accessed, either via reading or writing. In java, file I/O objects fall into two categories:

-   Streams: reading or writing bytes
-   Reader/Writer: reading or writing characters

Common File I/O classes:

-   FileInputStream - reads raw bytes from a file

-   FileOutputStream - writes raw bytes to a file

-   FileReader - reads characters from a file

-   FileWriter - writes characters to a file

-   BufferedReader - reads a file line by line, needs an instance of a FileReader with a path to the resource to be read in the constructor

-   BufferedWriter - writes to a file line by line, needs an instance of a FileWriter with a path to the destination file in the constructor

-   Scanner - can read from an InputStream, useful methods for character reading

Character files are read line by line, indicated by a newline character (\n) or a carraige return (\r)

You always want to be sure to close your resources when you are done reading/writing

The way you serialize data is with a FileOutPutStream and an ObjectOutputStream

The way you deserialize data is with a FileInputStream and an ObjectInputStream

# Add File I/O to the School System we are Building

# Garbage Collection

Java automatically removes objects from memory where there is no longer a reference to it

You cannot explicitly call for garbage collection, but you can suggest it with these methods

-   System.gc()
-   Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
-   System.runFinalize()
    -   Finalize is an inherited method from the object class, you can override it to implement some logic to run before you object is destroyed
