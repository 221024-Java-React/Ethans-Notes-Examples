# Packages and Imports

Packages are a way to organize your classes, interfaces, and enums into a folder structure

-   They follow the lowercase naming convention, with words separated by dots, in the reversee way you would call a web domain
-   com.example.package

You can access classes by their fully qualified names eg. package.classname

You can use import statements to pull in other classes

After importing the class or package we can just use it in the program
The java.lang package is imported by defaulted

# Modifiers

There are two types of modifiers, access and non-access

## Access Modifiers:

are keywords that define the ability of other code to access the given entity

There are 4 access modifiers, and they can be placed in front of classes, interfaces, enums and class members

-   public: available anywhere
-   protected: available within the same package, and this class' sub-classes
-   default(nothing): available within the same package
-   private: only available within the class

## Non-access Modifiers

There are 7, but we only use 4 often

-   static: is the keyword to denote that a class member has class scope, can be used on variables and methods
    -   static variables can be accessed through the class eg MyClass.staticVariable
    -   static methods can be called directly without needing an of the class, eg. MyClass.someMethod()
-   final: is the keyword that makes something unchangable
    -   when applied to a variable it cannot be reassigned
    -   when applied to a class it cannot be extended
    -   when applied to a method it cannot be overriden
-   abstract:
    -   when applied to a class, the class can no longer be instantiated directly, it must be inherited
    -   when applied to a method, the method must not have an implementation, any abstract method must be in an abstract class
-   transient:
    -   mark a variable as non-serializable, meaning it will not be persisted when written to a byte stream

# Variable Scopes

When a variable is declared in Java, it is attached to specific scope within the program, which determines where the variable resides

The different scopes are:

-   Instance of object:
    -   The variable belongs to an individual object created from a class
    -   When an instance varible is modified it has no effect on other objects of the same class
-   Class or static scope:
    -   The variable belongs to the class itself, every object of that class share this variable
    -   When a class variable is modified, the varible in all objects of that class is also changed
-   Method:
    -   The variable was created inside of a method block, so it is only available inside of that method
    -   Will no longer exist after the method has finished
-   Block:
    -   The variable only exists within a specific block of code
    -   A block of code is any code with {}
    -   Most typically if/else, for loops, while loops, after these are done executing the variable no longer exists

# Object Class

In Java the object class is the root of all class from which all other classes inherit

Therefore, all classes in Java will have these methods defined by the Object class:

-   Object clone()
-   boolean equals(Object o)
-   void finalize(): this is called by the garbage collector when it determines there are no more references to the object
-   Class<?> getClass()
-   int hashCode(): returns an int indicating the hashcode
-   void notify()
-   void notifyAll()
-   String toString(): this will be called automatically if you try to print the object, typically you want to override this method otherwise it will print the fully qualified class name
-   void wait()
-   void wait(long timeout)
-   void wait(long timeout, int nanos)

## Java Equality hashCode and equals

The int hashCode and equals are typically given their own implemenations when creating a custom class

hashCode() has a few rules to being overriden
-   If you override equals() you are also expected to override hashCode()
-   The result of hashCode() should not change in a program
-   if .equals() returns true the hashcode should be the same
-   if .equals() returns false, the hashcodes do not have to be distinct

equals() is overriden to be able to compare specific properties of objects because by default it will perform == on the objects memory location

# Java Abstract Classes and Methods

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are more general classes that cannot be instatiated, they act as templates for other classes to inherit

Abstract classes are created with the abstract keyword, and can contain both concrete and abstract methods

## Interfaces

Interfaces are contracts for methods that classes must implement, they also cannot be instantiated

Interfaces are implicitly public and abstract

-   Every method in an interface is public and abstract
-   Interfaces can have variables, they will implicitly be public static and final
-   In Java 8 default methods were added, which allow programmers to implement methods in an interface

To inherit from an interface a class must use te implements keyword in the class declaration

## Marker Interfaces

A marker interface is an interface that contains no methods or constants, its sould purpose is to provide runtime information to the compiler. Examples of this are Serializable, and Cloneable

# Abstraction DEMO

# Java Casting and Covariance

## Covariant Return Type:

-   When overriding a method you can change the return type as long as it is a subclass of the original return type
-   You can change the access modifier as long as it is not more restrictive
-   You can change the Exception as long as its a subclass of Exception

## Casting

Upcasting allows you to assign a child object to a parent object, this works because the child will have all of the behaviors of the parent, however you may be missing some of the childs functionality

Downcasting is the opposite, it allows you to assign a parent object to a child object, however you cannot garentee that the parent object will have all the properties of the child leading to problems

These work because of how memory refencing works

# Java Stack and heap memory

Inside of the JVM, our application memory is divided into the stack and the heap

The heap is allowed memory space for the application

-   The amount is allocated from machine to machine, we cannot control it
-   Inside of the heap there is the stack, and object
-   The `new` keyword will make a new instance of an object, the variable will point to the object in memory
-   You can run heap space causes an OutOfMemoryError

The stack is where method invocations and reference variables are stored

-   When a method is called it gets put at the top of the stack and gets executed
-   You can run out of stack space, causes a StackOverflowError

# Casting and Covariance DEMO

# Java Exceptions

Are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow, during these events an Exception object is thrown

-   You can recover from exception if you handle them

# Exceptions class hierarchy

The root of all exceptions is the Throwable class

-   Any class that extends this Throwable class is able to be "thrown" with the `throw` keyword

The Exception class and Error class that both extend Throwable

RuntimeException that extends Exception

From there, all exception extend either from the Exception or RuntimeException class

# Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

Checked exceptions are caught at compile time, and they are required to be handled by the programmer, otherwise your code will not run

-   In the hierarchy these are the classes NOT extending RuntimeException

Examples:

-   FileNotFoundException
-   ClassNotFoundException
-   CloneNotSupportedException

Unchecked Exceptions are caught during run-time, are not required to be handled by the programmer

-   In the hierarchy these are any exceptions that ARE a subclass of RunTimeException

Examples:

-   ArithmeticException
-   IndexOutOfBoundsException
-   NullPointerException

In Java there are also objects called Errors, these occur when something goes carstrophically wrong, and cannot be recovered from

Examples:

-   StackOverflow
-   OutOfMemory

# Handling or declaring checked exceptions

When you suspect that code may be at risk of throwing exception, it can be handled in two ways

1. You place the code inside of a try/catch block
2. You can declare the method could throw an exception with the `throws` keyword

-   Declaring it on the method will "duck" the exception, which hands the responisibility of handling the exception to which every entity called the exception

## try/catch/finally blocks:

You want to enclose the code that is suspect to throw an error inside of the try block of code

Inside of the parenthesis of the catch block, you should declare the exception that you are expecting to catch, and whatever logic should run if the exception occurs

The finally block will run regardless of the out of the try block

try/catch rules and multi-catch blocks

-   Multiple catches are aloud, but they must go from most specific to least specific
-   You can catch more than one exception per catch block using ||
-   The finally is optional
-   A try/finally block is legal, but a try block on its own is not

You can cause an exception yourself by using the `throw` keyword

## Java try with resources

Some resources which throw expections must be closed after using them
- Streams
- Connections

Java 7 implemented the AutoClosable interface and the try with resources convention

Any Class/Interface which implements the AutoClosable interface can be placed in a set of parenthesis of a try block

When the resource is done being used, the try block will automatically close the resource
- This will come in handy when we reach file reading and writing with Java

# Custom Execeptions

You can also create your own custom exceptions

-   You can create checked exceptions by extending the Exception class
-   You can create unchecked exceptions by extending the RuntimeException class

Which one you choose depends in whether you want to force the programmer to handle the exception

# Java Custom Exceptions and Reading The Stack Demo

# Annotations

Annotations are special constructs in Java which use the @ symbol followed by the name of the annotation

-   Annotations provide metadata about the source code to the compiler and JVM

Annotations can be placed over classes, methods, interfaces, and other constructs

Annotations are often used by libraries to abstract funcionality, or enforce some set of rules

-   Annotations are ofect processed by the Reflections API

Some examples include:

-   @Override
-   @Deprecated
-   @SuppressWarnings
-   @FunctionalInterface

# Intro to TDD and Unit Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a the process of writing tests for your code, then implementing the code to pass those tests

-   This helps increase code coverage

## Red/Green Testing

Red/Green testing is typically associated with TTD, and it is the process of writing a test before the code which results in red, writing the code to pass the specific test (green), then rewrite/create a new test that fails (red), refactor your code to pass (green), and so on until you have reached your ideal functionality

The process can be broken down into 5 steps

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test (it will fail)
3. Write code to pass the test
4. Retest, until the test passes
5. Repeat the process

# Unit Tests

Unit Testing: is the testing of individual software components in isolation from the rest of the software

It cal also be known as White Box testing:

-   a testing method in which the internal design of the item being tested is known to the tester

Unit testing can find if/where something goes wrong in your code

-   This helps reduce debugging time because you know where to look for the issue in the code
-   It also increases code coverage, because you should be testing each individual unit/module of code
-   It increases confidence in changinf and maintaining your code base

It is best practice to include both positive and negative test cases

# JUnit: is a Java framework for unit testing

It uses annotations to create tests and setup testing enviornments

-   `@Test` - declares a method as a test method
-   `@BeforeClass` - declares a setup method that runs once, before all other methods in the class
-   `@Before` - declares a setup method that runs before each test method
-   `@After` - declares a tear-down method that runs before each test method
-   `@AfterClass` - declares a tear-down method that runs once, after all other methods in the class

JUnit also has built in methods to use in your testing methods to verify the state of the application is what is expected:

-   `assertTrue()`
-   `assertFalse()`
-   `assertEquals()`
-   `assertNotEquals()`
-   `assertThat()`
