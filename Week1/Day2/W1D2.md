# Introduction to Java

## Java is a programming language that is:

High-leveled: Easy to read syntax, automatic mem management, garbage collection

Compiled: Progams are converted or compiled into Byte Code

Strongly Typed: Variables types must be defined at compile, and cannot be assigned

Object Oriented: Has constructs of classes and objects built in that allows programmers to follow the principles of Object Oriented Programming

## Advantages of Java (why we like to use it):

Java is platform idependent, you write once and run anywhere, this due to the JVM

It is widely popular with a rich API and countless libraries

It is Object Oriented

It has simple syntax to learn, based on the C programming language

It is free, and supported by Oracle

Has automatic mem management, and garbage collection

# First Program HelloWorld Demo

# JDK, JRE, JVM

## Java Development Kit (JDK):

This provides developer tools to develop Java Applications, it comes with:

-   The JRE
-   Debugger
-   Devtools
-   Compiler

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

This provides the build in libraries that Java needs to run code, it comes with:

-   the JVM
-   all neccessary libraries to run java code
-   it is the minimum requirement to run a Java program

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

This converts your Java Byte Code into machine readible code

-   This is OS specific
-   Includes the Classloader, runtime data area, execution engine, and heap and stack area

# Complete Java compilation and running process

1. Use the JDK to compile your source code in any .java files into byte code stored in .class files

    - This is done through the use of the JDK's built in program javac

2. Use the JRE to run the compiled class file from our program

    - The JRE comes with the program called java which runs a specificied class file

3. The JRE calls upon the JVM, the JVM takes the byte code stored in the class file and converts it to machine specific code and run the code you wrote

# Java Classes vs Objects

## Classes in Java

A class is a blueprint for an object

-   It will contail all of the properties and methods that the object will have

## Objects in Java

An object is a virtualization of a real world object

Created from a class, and hold states, behaviors, and indentity

States: property attributes (fields)

Behaviors: methods (a function that is attached to an object)

Identity: the name of the object

# Java Primitive Types w/Default Values

The only thing keeping Java from being completely Object Oriented,

The primitives include:

| Datatype | Size                             | Values                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| boolean  | 1 bit                            | true or false                              |
| byte     | 8 bit integer                    | -128 to 127                                |
| short    | 16 bit integer                   | -32768 to 32767                            |
| int      | 32 bit integer                   | ~ -2 billion to 2 billion                  |
| long     | 64 bit integer                   | -2^64 to 2^64-1                            |
| float    | 32 bit floating point            | -3.40252357 x 10^34 to 1.40239846 x 10^-45 |
| double   | 64 bit floating point            | -1.7976... x 10^308 to 4.9407... x 10^-324 |
| char     | 16 bit unicode character         |                                            |
| String   | Not a prim, but treated like one |                                            |

## Data type Default value

-   boolean: false
-   char: \u000 (0)
-   int: 0
-   float: 0.0f
-   reference types (objects): null

## Datatype casting:

Widening: Will occur automatically, Java will convert a smaller data type to a larger type

Narrowing: Will need to be done manually, converting a larger data type to a smaller data type

# Java Primitives DEMO

# Java Methods and Parameters, main method

## Methods are blocks of code which only run when called

-   Declared inside of classes, they must have a return type, name, and parameter list followed by curly braces

`return type name(params, param2, param3, so on and so forth){}`

## Parameters are specified inside of the parenthesis of the method

There is a special method called `main`, it is where the program execution occurs

-   There is only one per "program"

## Java Pass by Value

Java uses pass by value when passing variable to methods

-   This means a copy of the value is passed into the method, and original is not modifed

Java objects appear like they are pass by reference, however they are still pass by value

# Java Create Custom Class DEMO

# Constructors

Special methods that declare how an object is to be instantiated and initialized from their class

-   They do not have a return type
-   They return a new object

There are three types of constructors:

1. `default` gets created automatically when no other constructor is given in the class
2. `argument(s)` a constructor that takes in any number of parameters
3. `no-arg` a constructor that takes in no parameters, must be created by the programmer

No-arg and default are not the same, if you create a no-args constructor it will replace the default constructor

## The `this` keyword typically is used to set a variable that belongs to the specific class/object

## The `this()` keyword inside of the constructor to call another constructor in the current class, used to chain constructors

## The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the classes parent class, it is implicitly called on the first line of every constructor

# Strings and the String Pool

Strings are immutable, constant objects derived from the String class, the String object store sequences of characters as their value

Immutable means the state or value cannot be changed once the object is created

Strings are NOT primitives they are objects

All String methods return a new String object, the original is not modifed

The reason Strings are immutable are because of the String pool in memory

## String Pool:

a place in memory where strings are placed when created

-   This is stored in the Heap
-   Duplicate Strings are not allowed
-   If a String literal exists in the pool, any new matching String literal will point to the existing String in the pool

If you want to create a duplicate, you can create a new String object that will exist in the heap

-   If the string literal being used to create the object does not exist in the pool, it will be added

# StringBuilder and StringBuffer

StringBuilder and StringBuffer allow us to create mutable strings

-   Are mutable classes that hold a sequence of characters

They both have methods such as .append() and .insert() which mutates their internal sequence of characters

StringBuilder is not threadsafe, and StringBuffer is threadsafe

# Constructors And Strings DEMO

# Arrays and VarArgs

An array is a contigous block of memory storing a group of sequential elements of the same type

-   Arrays are of a fixed size, and cannot be resized
-   Arrays are declared with square brackets after the data type
-   Arrays are referenced via their index inside of the square bracket notation
    -   Indexes start at 0
    -   There is also a length property that specifies the length of the array

Arrays can also be multi-dimensional, you use multiple square brackets instead one

-   This store arrays insides of an arrays, forms a matrix like structure

VarArgs is short for variable arguments, and it is used to set an argument to a method whose size is determined at runtime

-   You use the ... notation instead of the array bracket notation
-   Java will convert this to an array under the hood, so you access the arguments the same way you would an array
-   There can only be one varargs, and it must be the last parameter

# Java Operators

| Operator             | Precedence                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| postfix              | x++ x--                                 |
| prefix               | ++x --x                                 |
| multiplicative       | \* / %                                  |
| additive             | + -                                     |
| shift                | << >> >>>                               |
| relational           | < > <= >=                               |
| equality             | == !=                                   |
| bitwise AND          | &                                       |
| bitwise exclusive OR | ^                                       |
| bitwise OR           | \|                                      |
| logical AND          | &&                                      |
| logical OR           | \|\|                                    |
| ternary              | expression ? true option : false option |
| assignment           | = += -= /= %=                           |

When we talk about logical AND

true && true = true
true && false = false
false && true = false
false && false = false

When we talk about logical OR

true || true = true
true || false = true
false || true = true
false || false = false

## Logical AND and OR will short circuit

-   the operation can determine the outcome by looking at only one side of the expression

# Operators DEMO

# Java Control Flow:

We can break up the normal of an application with conditional/branching statements and loops

Conditional/Branching:

-   if/else, if/else if, ternary operators, switch, try catch

Looping Statements:

-   for loops, enchanced for loops, while loops, and do-while loops

Conditional Statements run when a condition evalutates to true, or skips if its false

-   You can use if statements three ways
    -   single if
    -   if/else
    -   if/else if
-   Switch statements can conditionally check the equality of objects/variables
    -   They take a variable and attempt to match its content
    -   Only work with byte, char, short, int, String, and enums

Loop Statements repeat logic until the loop is finished

-   for loops run the logic inside for a set number of times
-   while loops runs the logic inside until a condition is false
-   do-while loop runs the logic inside of the while loop while a condition is true, expect it will always run at least once

## Break and Continue Keywords

Break can be used in loops, if statements, and switch statements

-   It will break out of the current block of code

Continue can only be used inside of loops

-   It will break out of the current iteration of the loop, and return to the top of the loop execution

# Basic Arrays and Control Flow DEMO

# Scanner Class

The scanner class in Java is used to scan input. It can be used to take in user input from the command line.

To use it import the scanner class was Java utils, then create a new scanner, with System.in to take in user input

# Trouble shooting a technical problem

When a problem arrises, you try different techniques to get to the bottom of the problem, and provide a solution

There are three best practices when it comes to trouble shooting

## Bottom Up Approach

When a user is experiencing issues or crashes, check any logs for and error or exception, and move up the thread until you find the issue

## Drill down into the issue

Try to get more information on the specifications, the configurations that were setup, and the events that happened.

## Start looking horizontally

Start checking your configurations, ingresses, secrets, volumes, nodes, or even deeper in your application logs. It could be an platform issue or an application issue to get down to the root cause.
- Configurations or secrets used in your application may be misaligned.
- Application logs can often be the last peice of the puzzle when debugging, but they can also be the most efficient

## Java Reading Documentation and Trouble shooting

When encountering issues specifically with programming in Java there are several ways to look for information or debug your code.

When it comes to information, the first place to look is the oracle java docs located here
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html
    - The oracle docs have documentation on every class included in the Java 11 API.
    - If you need documentation for none Java 11 API code search for "Java 'framework name' API documentation" you will most likely find the official java docs for the framework in the first couple of results on Google

Other sites I highly recomend for general documatation and tutorials of Java include:
- https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial
- https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/
- https://www.baeldung.com/

When it comes to debugging, there are a couple ways we can debug in java

The first, less efficient way is to use the main method of your program to make calls to methods inside of your application.

You can use this to print out values, to see if they match what you are expecting

You can also include System.out.println() statements throughout your code (only for development purposes) to make sure the code is reaching certain points you expect

Finally, the most recommended way of debugging your code is by using your IDE's debug feature.
- You can add breakpoints on specific lines of code, the IDE will stop running the code at these specific points
- Then you can walk through the code line by line, and even go into different methods to find the spot where you application stops running as expected.
