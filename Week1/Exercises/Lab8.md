# Create a new package in your Labs project called `lab8`
## Inside of the lab8 package, create a class also called `Lab8` and do the following:

# Complete the following method using a StringBuilder or StringBuffer

## Create a public method called `reverse` which returns a String
- ### The methods should take one parameter String, which is the String to be reversed

## Using Java operators and control flow reverse the input String
- ### As you are reversing the String, store the characters into a StringBuilder or StringBuffer
- (Hint) This can be done with a single for loop, and no extra temporary variables

## After the String is reversed convert the contents of the StringBuilder or Buffer into a String and return it

**NOTE YOU WILL NOT GET CREDIT IF YOU USE THE STRINGBUILDER OR STRINGBUFFER REVERSE METHOD**    

# Once you have completed the logic above, include the JUnit in your labs project like we did previously in training

# Write 2 Positive case tests and 2 Negative case tests in a new class called `Lab8Tests`

## Run the tests, and make sure they pass before you finish

## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
