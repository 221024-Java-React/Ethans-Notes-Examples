# Create a new package in your Labs project called `lab14`
## Create a class called `Lab14` with a main method for later

# Create a method inside of the Lab14 class to solve the following coding promt

## Race to the Ice Cream Truck

Two kids and an ice cream truck are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which kid will reach the truck first, assuming the truck does not move and the kids are running at equal speed. If the kids arrive at the truck at the same time, the truck will be allowed to move to the next corner while the kids fight over the last cone.

# Create the method called `twoKidsAndATruck()`

# 1. The method should take in three parameters
- ### int k1, the position of kid 1
- ### int k2, the position of kid 2
- ### int t, the position of the truck

# 2. The method should return:
- ### String "Kid 1" if the first kid is closer to the truck
- ### String "Kid 2" if the second kid is closer to the truck
- ### String "Truck" if the kids are the same distance from the truck

# Problem Example:

```
k1=7;
k2=4;
t=5;
```

## Explanation:

The kids are at positions 7 and 4, the truck is at position 5.

-   Kid 1 is 2 units away
-   Kid 2 is 1 units away
-   There for Kid 2 should arive first, and the method should return the String "Kid 2"

# Test out some different inputs inside of the main method you created earlier
## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
