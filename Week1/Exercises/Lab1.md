# Create a Java Project in the Repository you initialized yesterday
## Call the Java Project `Labs`

# Create a new class called `Lab1` and complete the following logic:

## 1. A boolean called `boo` which stores the value of true

## 2. A byte called `maxByte` which stores the max value of a byte datatype in Java

## 3. A short called `minShort` which stores the minimum value of a short datatype in Java

## 4. An int called `maxInt` which stores the maximum value of an integer datatype in Java

## 5. A long called `javaFlex` which stores the approximate amount of devices Java code currently runs on
- (Hint) It starts with a 3

## 6. A float called `pie` which stores the value of pie to the first 5 decimals (rounded down)

## 7. A double called `doubleYum` which stores the value of pie to the first 5 decimals rounded down times 2

# Create a main method in the `Lab1` class and print each of the above variables to the console

## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
