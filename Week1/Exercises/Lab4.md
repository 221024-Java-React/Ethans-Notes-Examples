# Create a new class called `Lab4` and complete the following logic:

## 1. Create an integer array with 100 indexes called `numbers`

## 2. Using a for loop fill the `numbers` array with the numbers 1 to 100

## 3. Create two new integer variables
- ### One called evenSum set to 0
- ### One called oddSum set to 0

## 4. Create a while loop which loops through the previously set `numbers` array and do the following
- ## if the number is even add the number to the evenSum variable
- ## otherwise add the number to the oddSum variable
- (Hint) You can use the modulus operator (%) to see if there is a remainder after dividing a number by 2
- (Hint) You may need to use another variable to know when to break out of the while loop 

# Create a main method in the `Lab4` class to print the result of your even and odd sums
## The sum of evens should be: 2550
## The sum of odds should be: 2500

## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
