# Create a new package in your Labs project called `lab10`
## Inside of the lab10 package create the needed classes to make a LinkedList which can store any datatype using Generics

# Your `GenericLinkedList` class should allow you to instantiate a linked list with any datatype

## 1. The linked list should be able to
- ### Add a item to the end of the list
- ### remove an item from a specific index
- ### get an item from a specific index

## 2. You may want to create a specific class called `Node` to store the data and link to the next node

## 3. Here are some helpful links to help you implement the linked list datastructure

- ### https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-a-linked-list-in-java-using-class/
- ### https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/linked-list-in-java/

## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHu
