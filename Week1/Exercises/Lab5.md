# Create a new class called `Lab5` and complete the following logic:

## Create a simple Scanner application to simulate a tic tac toe game:

## 1. Create a 2D array called `board` which can hold a 3x3 matrix of characters

## 2. Initialize the board array with all underscore characters `_`
- ### This should make is simpler to check for win conditions

## 3. Create a variabled called `currentPlayer` to keep track of who is currently playing

## 4. Write a method which returns boolean to check for the win condition

## 5. Write a method to check if the players move is valid, and place the peice on the board

## 6. Write a method to change the current player

## 7. Inside of the a main method, use a scanner and while loop to take user input for which index they would like to place their peice

## 8. Each iteration of the while loop should look like this:
- ### Ask which index they would like to place their piece
- ### Check if the move is valid, if it is place the piece, if not ask for a different location
- ### Check the win conditions
- ### If the current player won print a message saying they won
- ### If the current player did not win, switch players and start the loop over
- ### If it is a tie, print tie and end the game

## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
