# Create a new package in your Labs project called `lab13`
## Create a class called `Lab13` with a main method for later

# Create a method called `fizzBuzz`

## 1. The method will recieve a single integer parameter N

## 2. The logic of the method should go as follows
- ### If the number N is divisible by 3 return the string "Fizz"
- ### If the number N is divisible by 5 return the string "Buzz"
- ### If the number N is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 return the string "FizzBuzz"
- ### If none are true, return the number N as a string

# After you are finished, test out the method inside of the main method with different inputs
## Once complete, commit and push the completed Lab files to your remote repository on GitHub
