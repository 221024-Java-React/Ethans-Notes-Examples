# Normalization

Normalization refers to reducing redundancy of data and improving data intregrity and consistency

We focus on the first three forms:

## First Normal Form

-   Must have a primary key
-   No duplicants
-   Atomic Columns (break the columns up as small as you can)

## Second Normal Form

-   Must be first normal form
-   All attributes must depend on the primary key, (no partial dependencies)

## Third Normal Form

-   Must be second normal form
-   There are no transitive dependencies (data should only relate to the primary key nothing else)

### They key (1NF), the whole key (2NF), and nothing but the key (3NF), so help me Codd


# SQL Multiplicity

Multiplicity is the relationship between entries in different tables, defined by foreign key constraints

1. One-to-many: one entry in the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - The foreign key in the first is allowed to map to multiple entries in the second table
2. Many-to-one: this is the opposite of one-to-many
3. Many-to-many: Many entries of the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - These are implemented with what are called junction tables
4. One-to-one: a single entry in the first table is mapped to a single entry in the second table
    - The foreign key of both tables are unique

## Referntial Integrity

-   A foreign key is the reference to the relationship in multiplicity, and the rule ensures that a referenced record always exists
-   You are not allowed to delete an entry if an entry of another table depends on it
-   You can use cascade delete, which will delete all children and parent entries

# Views

Virtual table in SQL, they are created using DQL statements

Advantages of Views:

-   Gives access to some but not all of the data in a table
-   Hide complexity of a database from users
-   Allow users to query normalized tables easily
-   Changes to the underlying table(s) are automatically reflected in views

# Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions take multiple rows, and combine the values into a single column

Some popular aggregate functions:

-   MAX(Column): returns the max value of that column
-   MIN(Column): returns the min value of that column
-   AVG(Column): returns the average value of that column
-   SUM(Column): returns the sum of the values in that column
-   COUNT(Column): return the number of elements in that column

These functions are used in the SELECT clause, and cannot be used with the WHERE clause

If more than one column is being selected in the SELECT column section, a GROUP by is required

You can also use the HAVING clause with an aggregate function instead of WHERE

# Scalar Functions

Scalar function operates on a single row, these can be used with SELECT and WHERE

Some popular scalar functions:

-   LENGTH(string): returns the length of a string in the given row
-   UPPER(string): return the string in all upper case
-   LOWER(string): returns the string in all lower case
-   ABS(num): returns the absolute value of the number
-   CEILING(num): returns the number rounded up
-   FLOOR(num): returns the number rounded down

# Sub queries

A query inside of a query, you can replace any DML statement with a SELECT statement

-   use the results from the inner query in the outer query

# Joins:

a way to combine two tables on specified columns/denormalize tables

-   Normally comparing primary and foreign keys
-   They can be done on any column as long as the types match

# Types of Joins:

## Inner

Is the most common, it returns rows that match the specified join clause

## Outer

The Outer keyword can be used with LEFT RIGHT and FULL to specify what kind of outer join you like to do

## Left

Returns the matching rows and the ones that are null on the first table

## Right

Returns the matching rows and the ones that are null on the second table

## Full

Returns all rows from both tables, including the ones that are null from both tables

## Self

This performs an inner join between two columns inside the same table, representing a hierarchy

## Cross

Returns the cartesian product or two or more tables

## Natural

Will join tables based off of matching column names

# Set Operators:

Similar to joins, however instead of joining tables, they combine rows of returns sets from queries

Some important Set Operators are:

## Union: returns everything between the two sets without duplicates

Union All will return duplicates

## Intersect: returns the records the queries have in common

## Minus: Removes any row from the first set, that is also present in the second set, and returns the result

## Except: Does the opposite of minus
