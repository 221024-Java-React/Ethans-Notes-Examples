# Mockito: is Java framework that allows us to mock the functionality of other methods

-   This allows for black box testing:
    -   Where you don't know the functionality of a given item, we just need the output
-   This is extremely useful for testing methods that rely on the output of other methods
-   You replace the depedency of the other method with mocks and stubs

A stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values

A mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished to see how it interacted with the class under the test

## Mocking Objects w Mockito

Mockito uses annotations to implement its mocking, to mock an object you put `@Mock` above it

-   Mocking an object gives you the ability to prevent the object from doing something, and just tell it what to do
-   This is useful when one piece of code relies on another module, you can have a garenteed return from the dependent module by using mocking

If you have an object that requires other modules, you can use `@InjectMocks` above the object to give it the dependencies needed

Finally, to be sure the mocking is going to work, you will need to enable the Mockito annotations, to do this you can create a method to run before the test suite with `@Before` and inside of that method call `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`
