# Introduction to RDBMS

DBMS: Database Management System

-   These are what we use to store and manage data in our database
-   The ultimate goal of a data base it to persist data

RDBMS: Relation Database Management System

-   This is what we will be using during training
-   Relational Databases are used to store information in tables that have relations with one another
-   RDBMS's are structured so that it maintains the security, accuracy, integrety and consisistency of data

Non-Relational Database Management System

Uses some other way to model data being stored.

Typically with NoSQL databases which can store data in files, or massive excel like sheets with columns of dynamic data

## Database:

A collection of structured data, typically grouped into tables

-   Each table has rows and columns
    -   The row will hold the information about the particular entry
    -   The columns are the attributes of the items in the table


# SQL: Structured Query Language

Underlying Language used to query relational databases

-   Not a programming language
-   Has an English like syntax

## Database Vendors

There are many different RDBMS vendors/flavors of SQL:

-   Oracle
-   PostgreSQL
-   MYSQL
-   Microsoft SQLServer
-   Microsoft Access

# SQL Data Types

Tables in your databases have attributes that describe the data being stored in the row, these attributes can be of many different datatypes

Common datatypes:

-   boolean (bool): evaluates to true or false
-   character (char[n]) : a fixed length character string
-   character varying (varchar[n]): a varying length string of characters
-   date: calendar date
-   integer (int): whole number
-   numberic/decimal: a decimal number

PostgreSQL documenation on datatypes:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html

# Schema:

A database schema refers to the formal structure of data defined by a relational database, this includes:

-   the various tables in the data and their columns and data types
-   the relationships between tables in the database

Schemas enforce contraints when defining tables, so we can visualize them through Entity Relationship Diagrams

# Constraints

Constraints are restrictions that we can put on the columns of our tables in SQL

This is esentially how we are capable of enforcing/creating the schema of the database

Some constraints are:

-   Composite keys: a key that uses more than one column
-   Not null: the column must have data
-   Unique: no two records entered inot this column can be the same
-   Primary Key: denotes that this column is a primary key
-   Foreign Key: denotes that this column is pointing to an attribute on another table
-   Default: create a default value if one is not given
-   Serial: the old way to implement an auto generated primary key
-   Indentity: the new way to create a primary key automatically

# Reading an ERD

Illistrate how different tables in a database relate to one another

They contain three main components:

The entity:

-   What the table is representing

Attributes:

-   These are the columns of the table

Relationships:

-   Theses are the connections between the tables

# SQL Primary and Foreign Keys

## Primary Key

A unique indentifier for that row in the table
- Always none null and unique

## Foreign Keys

-   Make relations between tables
-   Do not need to be unique, but can be
-   Can be made of one or more columns
-   A foreign key made of multiple columns is called composite key

# SQL Sublanguages

There are 5 sublanguages in SQL

## Data Definition Language (DDL):

-   Use to define the database itself
-   Deals with creation, alteration, or deletion of tables, schemas, or databases themselves
-   Syntax/Keywords for DDL:
    -   CREATE: used to create a new table, schema, or database
    -   ALTER: used to make changes to a table, schema or database
    -   DROP: used to completely remove/delete a table
    -   TRUNCATE: used to remove the data from a table, but keep the structure intact

## Data Control Language (DCL):

-   This sublanguage is ued to manage the security and control of our databases
-   Syntax/Keywords for DCL:
    -   GRANT: grant any permissions to a user
    -   REVOKE: remove any permissions to a user

## Data Manipulation Language (DML):

-   Used to change data inside of the database
-   Often refered to as the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    -   This is the theoretical construct of what you should be able to do with data in a table
-   Syntax/Keywords for DML:
    -   INSERT: used to add data into a table
    -   SELECT: used to retreive data from a table
    -   UPDATE: used to update data in a table
    -   DELETE: used to remove data from a table

# Spin up Postgres Container

Use: docker run --name postgre_container -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password --network (network-name) -d postgres

## Basic SQL queries (Examples/DEMO)

## Data Query Language (DQL):

-   This one is often debated, however it exists in PostgreSQL so we teach it
-   The debate itself is whether is should its own sublanguage or a sublanguage of DML
-   Syntax/Keywords for DQL:
    -   SELECT: used retrieve data from a table
-   Typically DQL refers to when we use SELECT with constraints, aka the "WHERE" clause

# Other Notible Keywords:

-   WHERE: used to narrow down the query results of your SELECT statement
-   ORDER BY: used to sort data returned by the select statement by a specific row
-   GROUP BY: used to group rows by a column and perform an aggregate function on them
-   HAVING: similar to the WHERE clause, but used in conjunction with an aggregate function

## Transaction Control Language (TCL):

Used to manage transactions within a database
- Transaction is any change that happens our tables
- Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
    - COMMIT: this will perminently save any DML operations that occured
    - ROLLBACK: with will completely erase any non commited DML operations
        - Keep in mind, once you commit, you cannot roll back
    - SAVEPOINT: this creates a point to roll back to, but if you commit, it will be gone

# DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE

DROP is a keyword in DDL which completely gets rid of something from the database

TRUNCATE is a keyword in DDL which clears the data from something in the database, but leaves the schema intact

DELETE is a keyword in DML which removes a specific item/s from a database

This are going to typically be used with tables
