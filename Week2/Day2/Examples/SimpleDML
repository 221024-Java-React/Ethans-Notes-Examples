-- If we wanted to narrow down the query results we can use the DQL language with the Where clause

-- Only select the teachers from the table (teachers have type 1)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE type = 1;

-- We can update specific records with the DQL
UPDATE users SET password = 'p4ssword' WHERE email = 'veronica.vaughn@school.com';

-- If we only want to select specific data from a row, we can specify that instead of the * wildcard
-- We can also give the returned data a different name using alias'
-- List the first and last names of all the people who have not changed their default password
SELECT first_name AS first, last_name AS last FROM users WHERE password = 'password';

-- We can also specify records to delete with the where clause
DELETE FROM users where id = 6;

-- Order by allows us to sort elements in descending or ascending order
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_name;

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_name DESC;

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 3;

SELECT * FROM users WHERE not id=3;

SELECT * FROM users WHERE type = 1 AND id > 1;
