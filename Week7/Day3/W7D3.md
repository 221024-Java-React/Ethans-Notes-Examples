# Amazon Web Services Intro (AWS):
Cloud computing services that are provided by Amazon
- providing a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and more

## Advantages of Cloud Computing:
- Pay as you go, aka
- Lower pay as you go prices due to economies of scale
- Automatically scale up or down
- Easily and quickly alocate resources
- Less startup cost (no needs to buy server equipment)
- Deploy your application globally in seconds

## Cloud Computing Models

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- a self-service model for managing remote data center infrastructures

Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- allows organizations to build, run and manage applications without IT infrastructure

Software as a Service (SaaS):
- replaces traditional on-device software with software that is licensed on a subscription basis

## AWS region:

AWS follows pay as you go, with the free tier options

AWS is also available in over 24 regions, with 77 Availibilty zones

geographic location with a collection of availability zones

## Availability Zone:
A physical data center inside of a region

# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):
a service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud.
- cost-efficient, resizable capacity for industry standard relational databases
- manages database administration tasks

# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

AWS EC2 is a service that provides secure, resizeble compute capacity in the cloud. In is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers

An Amazon EC2 Provides:
- A virtual computing environ, (you can host you java appliation here)
- Preconfigured environment templates called AMI (Amazon Machine Images)
    - These contain virtual images of a server, that contains the OS, and software you might want/need for hosting an application
- You can configure the CPU, MEMORY, Storage, etc to be whatever you need
    - The more resources added the more expensize
- It has secure login with ssh keys, and firewalls to prevent unwanted traffic

The firewalls are known as **Security Groups**
- These are set at an instance level, it holds a series of white listed ips we are explicitly allowing

Elastic Block Storage (EBS): provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2's
- If you need extra storage, you can setup, and attach one of these to your EC2

# Scaling an applications

We have two ways of scaling an application, one is vertical, and one horizontal

Vertical Scaling: giving the server the application is running on more resources, more cpu cores, more memory etc

Horizontal Scaling: is spinning up extra servers, and running your application across several resources, with special routing between them

AWS EC2's can use honizontal scaling automatically

## EC2 Autoscaling

Allows you to scale up or down resources for your application automatically to mantain availablity of your application

AWS provides horizontal scaling

## Benefits of Autoscaling:
- Improved Fault Tolerance: detect a fault instance and replace it with a new one
- Increased Application Availablity: insure your application has the right amount of compute power at any given time
- Lower costs: only need to increase the number of instances when you need it, instead of paying the increased number the entired time

## Autoscaling groups
Collections of EC2 instances with similar characterstics
- You can use these to increase the number of instance to improve performance
- You can use these to descreate the number of instances to reduce cost
- You can use these as fixed amounts of instances

Launch configurations allows you to set certain parameters used for autoscaling

Scaling Plans tell how and when to scale, there are three plans
- Scheduled Scaling
- Dynamic Scaling
- Predictive Scaling

More information, and how to set it up can be found here:

# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):
object storage service that offers indusrty-leading scalablility, data availablity, security, and performance.
- store and retrieve almost any amount of data from anywhere

S3 uses what is called object storage, where each object is stored in its own bucket
- You can access these buckets via a dedicated URL given by amazon
- You can use these buckets to backup files, host static websites, host media, host applications
- You can access, and add items to a bucket with API's which is very useful

## Hosting Static sites on S3

1. Sign into the AWS Management console and open the AWS S3 Console
2. Choose create bucket
3. In Bucket name, choose a DNS-compliant name
    - Must be unique across all of Amazon
    - Be between 3 and 63 characters
    - No uppercase characters
    - Start with a lowercase or number
4. In Region, choose the AWS region where you want the bucket to reside
5. In the Bucket settings for Block Public Access, uncheck the Block Public Access settions that you want to apply to the bucket
6. Choose Create bucket
7. Choose the S3 Bucket you just created and choose the properties tab
8. Scroll to the bottom to the `static web hosting option`
9. Click `Edit`
10. Edit the options to the following:
    - `Static website hosting`: enabled
    - `Hosting type`: Host a static website
    - `Index document`: index.html
11. Setup a custom policy to allow access to everyone to everything
