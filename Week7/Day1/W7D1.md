# Intro to DevOps

DevOps is the combination of Development and Operations

And is a set of practices and methodologies designed to combine the production/writing of code and deployment/maintenance of code into one stream lined process

The primary goal of DevOps is to expedite the lifecycle of application development, particulary through the automation of tasks

This can help save money, and decrease time between releases

There is generally fives or phases to DevOps:

1. Source Code Control: Producing (writing) code and pushing to a repository
2. Building and testing automation: Test basic functionality of code, generally writing unit tests, and create a new working build
3. Deploying to staging: Deployment of working builds to a temporary environment
4. Acceptance Testing: Undergo more complex tests, (systems, integration) within the temporary environment
5. Deployment of Build: Migrate working build to the production environment access by end users

## DevOps and Agile

Adoption of the Agile process can provide a stepping stone for the establishment of a working DevOps pipeline

The processes of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are used with agile to automate the phases of DevOps as much as possible

# Continuous Integration (CI):

CI is the process of regularly and consistently merging code into a central repository and reviewing new code to ensure that it integrates well within the previously established code base

It is the first and most fundamental step in creating an autonomous development pipeline

It is a development team mentality, and it is achieveed when all members of the development team practice consistent merging of code into a central repository, these whould be in form of version control software

Continous Integration provides the following benefits:

-   Ensures the entire team works on the most up to date code
-   Detect broken builds quickly
-   Code can be tested easily by creating separate test or development branches
-   Reduces the risk in development when a large code base had already been established
-   Reduces the overall amount of bugs in the project

# Continuous Delivery (CD):

CD allows for the building, management, and testing of produced software to be automated such that deployments can be performed at the push of a button

It is dependent upon the implementation of Continuous Integration, it can take code that is being pushed regularly, and build, test, and deploy it to a production like enviornment for final testing

The application is automatically ready for release, and can be released with the push of a button

Benefits of Continuous Delivery:

-   Reduced risk in deployment
-   Predictible progress
-   Frequent feedback

# Continuous Deployment (CD):

This is the final step in completely automating your software production

It will automatically build, test, and deploy your software to the production environment, anything code is pushed to main branch

It is essentially the final addition to Continuous Delivery, it is the fully automated pipeline

Benefits of Continous Deployment:

-   Even faster development process, without the need to pause for deployment
-   New releases are less risky, as small changes can be can be easily recognized and fixed, allowing for better and quicker feedback
-   Increased communication and regular streams of improvements are generally seen as a good thing from customers

Cost/Risks of Continuous Deployment:

-   Establishing a Continous Deployment pipeline requires more substantial investment in engineering and testing culture
-   Documentation of processes is required to communicate to development, production, and testing team
-   Ongoing maintenance of deployment pipleine is required to ensure work continues running smoothly, increasing production costs
-   Feature flags are required for coordination between departments
