# Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server, which can be used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software.

It can installed standalone on a system, or work with tools like Docker

## Jenkins Projects, Jobs, and Builds

In Jenkins you work with Projects/Jobs:
- Each job is a repeatable set of steps that automate a task
- You can trigger your jobs manually, externally, or by other jobs
- When a job is triggered, it create a build

Jobs have status called Health. The health is represented by a weather condition
- Sunny: 81% or more build passed
- Partially Sunny: 61 - 80% passed
- Cloudy: 41 - 60% passed
- Raining: 21 - 40% passed
- Stormy: 20% or less passed

Builds have a more traditional status, each one gets a colored circle representing success or failure
- Blue: success
- Yellow: unstable
- Red: Failure
- Gray: No builds/aborted build

## Jenkins Pipeline Setup with Github

1. SSH into the VM instance

2. Install git:

```
sudo yum install git
```

3. Install Maven:
```
sudo wget https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo

sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo

sudo yum install -y apache-maven

mvn -v
```

4. Install Jenkins:
```
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key

sudo yum upgrade

sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

sudo yum install jenkins
```

5. Start the Jenkins Service
```
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

sudo systemctl start jenkins

sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

6. Retrieve the Jenkins Admin Password
```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

7. Visit `http://EC2IP:8080` to view the Jenkins dashboard

8. Once on the Jenkins dashboard
  - Input the Admin Password
  - Install suggested plugins
  - Skip creating a new admin
  - Skip setting up a url
  - Finish and continue to the dashboard

9. Setup the github webhook
  - Go to your github repo page then go to Webhooks > Add Webhook
  - Set payload URL to http://EC2IP:8080/github-webhook/
  -   Set the content type to application/json
  -   Choose `Let me select individual events`
    -   Pull Requests, Pushes
  -   Add Webhook
  -   If the delivery fails, try to fix the issue and redeliver

10. Setup the Jenkins Job to Pull and Build your code
  - New Item > Name it > Free Style Project > OK
  -   Description > Can be literally anything
  -   Source Code Management > Git > Paste the URL to the Repo
  -   Branches to Build > \*/main
  -   Build triggers > Github hook trigger for GitScm polling
  -   Build > Add Build Step > Execute Shell

11. Setup the Execute shell
  - Start with `ls` to see the package structure from github
```
ls
echo Change directory into the root project folder
cd ERSBoot
echo Making sure Jenkins recognizes the maven install
mvn -version
echo Test and Build our project
mvn clean install
```

12. If the build succeeds, you can access the jar file at /var/jenkins_home/workspace/JOBNAME/target/JARNAME

13. From here, you can either run it manually with `java -jar JARNAME.jar` or setup a separate jenkins job to automatically run the jar for you


# SonarCloud/SonarLint

SonarCloud and SonarLint are code quality analysis tools which increase the readablity, security, and maintainability of code

These tools can help produce higher quality code, and provide standardization between developers

Code Quality Analysis tools are programs specifically designed to expose errors as well as code smells

- Code Smells: Charachteristics of the code that while not actually preventing proper functionality, they may enventaully prevent the maintainablity of you code
- Vulnerabilities: data security issues
- Bugs: issues with the actual code functionality
- Maintainability Issues:
    - Confusing or hard to maintain code
    - Repeated Instances of code
    - Unused imports
    - Empty code blocks
    - Unaddressed automated code comments

SonarCloud is a cloud based review solution which can be configured to review code witin a cloud repositotr, such as Github

How to setup Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/getting-started/github/

Sonar Lint is a free, opensource linting tool which you can install directly into your IDE

Traditional IDE's use some sort of linter, but Sonar Lint provides further linting as listed above

To install on Eclipse/STS, you can simply go to the market place and search for Sonar Lint and install
