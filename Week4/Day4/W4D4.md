# Form Elements and Its Attributes

Use forms to collect data from users of the website

-   Use the `<form>` tag to create a new form

The form tag has the following attributes you can set:

-   action: typically the URL of the server where you are sending information
-   target: tells the webpage where to load the new page
-   method: specify which http method to use when submitting

The `<input>` tags inside of the form can having the following attributes

-   name: provides a label for that specific input field
-   value: allows you to specify an initial value for the field
-   placeholder: allows you to specify a placeholder text for the form field
-   required: makes it so the user must fill out this field
-   min/max: specify a minimum or maximum value for the field

## Input Elements and Input Types

The input element is used to get information from the user inside of the form tags, there are many types of input elements inlcuding:

-   text: one line text input
-   password: test field where the input is hidden
-   radio: buttons that only allow one selection per group
-   check boxes: buttons that allow multiple selections per group
-   file select: allow users to upload files
-   textarea: a multiline multicolumn text field
-   select: allows for a user to select from a dropdown
-   reset and submit: which do exactly as they sound

## Select and Multi-Select

Select is a special input field which allows uses to select values from a drop down box

To use it you use the `<select></select>` tag with nested `<option></option>` tags to display the options of the drop down

There is a special attribute that allows you to let users select multiple values from a select dropdown called `multiple`

Simply add the `multiple` keyword in your select, and it will allow windows users to hold the `ctrl` key to select multiple options and mac users to hold the `command` key to select multiple options


# HTML5 Validation

Before sending form data we want to perform what is called client side form validation

There are two ways of accomplishing this:

-   Javascript and bult-in form validation

HTML5 introduced several ways to validate form data:

-   required attribute: forces the user to fill out that specified field
-   minlength and maxlength: indicate the minimum or maximum length text can be
-   min and max: indicate the min and max amount a numeric field can be
-   type: defines the type the data should be
-   pattern: defines a pattern (regular expression) that entered data should follow

When data is verified and it satisifies the constraints, they are considered valid, and will be given the CSS psuedo class :valid which can be used to modify the look of the page if the users input is valid

The opposite is also true, id validation doesn't go through, the input will be given the CSS psudeo class of :invalid which can be used to modify the look of the page if the users input is invalid

# Submitting Forms

There are two ways you can submit a form

1. Using the default action of the submit button, this will send any data to the url specified with the method type specified in the form attributes. This will automatically reload the page.

2. The preferred way is to register an onsubmit listener for the form and preventDefault. This way you can control how the request is sent, and when to reload or navigate to a different page on your website

# Intro to Asynchronous Javascript

program does not need to wait for a specific task that takes a long time

It simply start executing the function, then moves on to the next function while it finishes

-   You can send a request/start a lengthy function, and forget about it
-   Then when you receive the reponse/the function is finished you can handle it
-   You program does not need to wait for the response in the mean time

This is useful with API calls, and other processes that could hold up or "block" the execution of your programs main thread

## How Asynchronous Javascript Works

Javascript implements a stack where functions calls are stored

-   It uses a single thread to add, and call functions on the stack one at a time, until the stack is empty
-   This is how basic synchronous programming works

Javascript also has a built in queue, and the browser/node runtime environment has extra threads that can used by Javascript, the queue is used by the event loop

## Javascript Event Loop

When an asynchronous call happens, Javascript allows the browser thread/web api to handle the specific call, while moving on in the stack

Once the web api is done processing the function, it will return the callback or the response to the queue, then the next time the call stack is empty, the event loop will return response/callback from the queue

## Basic Animation of the event loop

## Basic Steps of the Event Loop in JS

1. Asynchronous call gets added to the stack
2. JS decides to hand it off to the web api where it processes
3. Other functions can be added and executed on the call stack while the web api works
4. Once the web api has a response it gets added to the queue
5. The event loop checks the queue when the call stack is empty to see if something needs to be added to the call stack
6. Our response/callback is added to call stack and process as normal

# Promises

Javascript uses promises for async opperations, they are placeholders for a future value. Many async functions return implicitly

Promises in Javascript are objects, and you create them using the new keyword

Promises take a callback function called the executor, this automatically runs the when the object is created

-   The executor also takes two callbacks, resolve and reject
    -   `resolve(value)` return the result of the job once it finishes sucessfully
    -   `reject(error)` is called when there is an error with processing the job

Promises have a property called status which gives us information about the state of the object. The promise can be in one of three states

-   pending
-   fulfilled
-   rejected

The promise objects connects the executor and any consuming functions which will receieve the result or the error from the promise

You would use `.then()` `.catch()` and `.finally()` methods on the promise object to consume (chain) the results or errors of the promise object

# Errors

When something goes wrong in Javascript an Error object is created, and there are two ways this can occur

1. Runtime error: An error that is created as a result of something wrong with the code
2. User defined error: An error built as part of your code to represent a problem that can occur.
    - These user defined fields can have many fields depending on implementation, the standard ones are name and message

## Handling Errors

You can handle an Error in Javascript with a try catch block
- Surround the at risk code in a try block
- If something occurs, we can handle the Error in the catch block. Similar to Java

## Throwing Errors

If you want to throw an error yourself, you can use the `throw` keyword
- You can actually throw anything in Javascript, but somethings wouldn't make much sense

## Custom Errors in Javascript

There are two ways to create a custom Error in Javascript

1. Creating a new function with a name and message field, set the prototype of the object to Error
2. Creating a class the extends Error, and passing in a message to the parent constructor using the `super()` keyword

# Fetch API

fetch is a more modern and versatile way of making AJAX requests
The fetch API is provided by the window object, and provides the `.fetch()` method

-   `.fetch()` is used to send requests and returns a promise that is retrieved from the response
-   Successful requests get resolved, the returned promise will have the response body
-   Request that return an error HTTP-Status will be rejected

There are various methods you can use to access the response body of a success request:

-   `response.text()` read the response and return as text
-   `response.json()` parse the response as JSON
-   `response.formData()` return the response as FormData object
-   `response.blob()` return the response as Blov (binary data with type)
-   `response.arrayBuffer()` return the response as an ArrayBuffer (low level representation of binary data)

# async/await

introduced in ES8 to simplify asynchronous functionality

The async keyword denotes that a function will operate asynchronously via the event loop

-   Any function with the async keyword will implicitly return a promise object
-   Yuo can use any of the consumer function on the return of an async function, however there are nicer ways to handle these promises using await

The await keyword only works inside of async functions

-   await tells Javascript to wait for a promise to resolved before moving on
-   You can use await when calling any function that returns a promise, but it must be inside of an async function
-   It allows you to gather data, or wait for something while also not blocking the main thread

You no longer need to chain consumer functions together, making your code easier to read

# Timing Events

are functions that are attached to the global window object, and allow programmers to automate or run tasks after waiting a specific amount of time

These get handled by the event loop and web threads

## setTimeout()

`window.setTimeout(callbackFunction, milliseconds)` will execute the callback function after waiting for a specific amount of milliseconds

Use the `window.clearTimeout(timeoutVariable)` to stop a timeout before the execution of the callback function

## setInterval()

`window.setInterval(callbackFunction, milliseconds)` continually executes the callback function ever so many milliseconds

Use `window.clearInterval(intervalVariable)` to stop the interval, similar clearTimeout
