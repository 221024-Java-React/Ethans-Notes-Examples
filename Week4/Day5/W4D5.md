# Agile/Scrum Concepts

Scrum is the simplest Agile framework, it enforces ceremonies lead by a lead who ensures the team is following Scrum practices

## Scrum Artifacts

-   Product Owner: holds authority over project, a representative of the client/customer
-   Scrum Master: the person who mediates all the meetings, and goes between client and team
-   Project Backlog: holds all the current requirements for the project
-   Sprint Backlog: requires that are to be completed in the current sprint
-   User Story: an individual feature/requirement
-   Epic: a group of related features that is broken down into multiple user stories
-   Sprint: a brief period of development, (between 2 and 4 weeks). which generally cumulates in a release of realated features
-   Velocity: the sum of story points of all the user stories completed that week

## Story Pointing

Story pointing allows teams to keep track of the progress (velocity) of their sprint/project, and create burndown charts

Burndown Charts: chart the amount of story points that been completed each day, vs the number of points remaining

When assigning story points, it should be a team discussion, that includes consideration of Risk, Complexity, and Repetition of the user story

It is also recommended to use a number fib sequence:

-   1: "trivial"
-   2: "easy"
-   3: "medium"
-   5: "difficult"

## Scrum Ceremonies:

meetings used during the life cylce of the sprint in a project

Sprint Planning:

-   Include the entire dev team, scrum master, product owner
-   Happen before every sprint
-   Determine the scope, goals, and metrics of the sprint

Daily Standup/Scrum:

-   This is a daily meeting lead by the scrum master
-   Takes aprox. 15 minutes
-   Everyone tells what they are working on, what they are stuck on, and their goals for the day

Sprint Review:

-   Everyone is invited to this meeting
-   Review what the team accomplished at the end of a sprint
-   Gain feedback

Sprint Retrospective:

-   Scrum master reviews the metric, and assess any ineffiencies
-   Plan to make improvemtents as a team

# Install NodeJS
# Node.JS

Node JS is an open-source, cross-platform, run-time environment for Javascript, built on Chrome v8 engine

-   It is NOT a programming language
-   It is a run-time environment that allows you to run Javascript outside of the browser

## npm or Node Package Manger

Is a package manager for the javascript programming language. It is the default manager of the node js environment

npm consists of three components:

-   the website: discovers packages, sets up profiles, and manages access to packages
-   CLI runs from the terminal and allows us to interact with npm
-   the registry is a public database of Javascript packages

We use Node and npm as tools for building Angular applications


# package.json

When you create a Javascript project with node, it automaticall creates a package.json in the root directory of the project

The package.json holds information/metadata about the project:

-   description
-   version
-   license information
-   author
-   entry point
-   dependencies
-   scripts

There are two types of dependencies in package.json

-   dependencies: are essential to running the application
-   devDependencies: are dependencies that are only being used during development of the application

# Modules

We can export and import peices of our Javascript code to and from different script files

-   You use the export statement to create a module
-   You use the import statement to use a module
-   We will see this be used a lot when we reach frontend frameworks

With NodeJS, to be allowed to use the feature, you must add:
json
```
"type":"module"
```

to the package.json file

# Typescript Intro

Typescript is an open-source, objected-oriented, typed, superset of Javascript, created by Microsoft

-   It contains all functionality of JavaScript
-   With additions of classes, interfaces, inheritance, modules, and more
-   It is portable across browsers and devices
-   It supports strong/static typing

Typescript is not directly readible by the browser, you must transpile the typescript into javascript before running it in the browser or in node

To install typescript, we use `npm install -g typescript`

To compile the TS into JS, you use the `tsc` command which will output a javascript file with the same name

## Datatypes

Like Javascript you still declare variables with var, let, const, however you now must declare a type:

-   ex. `let varname : [type] = value`

There are 11 datatypes in Typescript

-   Boolean: true or false
-   Number: integer, or decimal number
-   String: text inclosed in single or double quotes
-   Undefined: same as JS
-   Null: same as JS
-   Any: acts as normal JS variables
-   Void: used for functions that do not return anything
-   Arrays: dynamic size like JS, store a single datatype
-   Tuples: an array that can store a fixed number of objects
-   Enum: declare a set of named constants
-   Never: represents a type of value that never occur

# Classes and Access Modifiers

In typscript the `class` keyword is used to declare a class, and the `new` keyword can be used to create a new instance of a class

You can implement inheritance with typescript classes using the extends keyword, similar to Java

Typescript has three access modifiers:

-   public: the default modifier, can be accessed anywhere
-   private: can only be accessed inside the class
-   protected: can only be accessed inside of the class or child classes

We can also make properties read only with the readonly modifier

In typscript, the code we write is globally scoped by default. To restrict this, typescript provide modules and namespaces. All variables, classes, and functions declared in a module are not accessible outside of said module

You can create a module using the export keyword, and you can use other modules by using the import keyword

Typescript supports getters and setters to access and set class members, you simple put set and get keyword to create these mutators. You can use these as properties rather than functions.

# Interfaces

Interfaces allus us to create contracts that other classes/objects can implement

You define an interface withe the `interface` keyword, which incldes the properties you want the class/object to have

You can include optional properties with the `?`

The typescript compiler does not convert the interface, it just uses it for type checking
