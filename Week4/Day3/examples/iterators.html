    it resumes executing from where it left off until the next yield or return keyword.

    An iterable object is one which implements the iterable protocol, which means that we can get an iterator
    object which will allow us to iterate through the object. A generator is just a special type of iterator.
    To implement the iterable protocol, and thus define iteration behavior, we simply need to create a function
    that returns an iterator. That iterator object defines how we iterate.

    The following iterableObject has a function that is identified by "[Symbol.iterator]". Don't worry too
    much about this unique syntax, it's just the name of the function. The name includes [square brackets].

    That [Symbol.iterator]() function returns the iterator object. You could utilize this object to
    iterate, but you are better off using it implicitly as part of a for...of loop. The for...of loop 
    requires an iterator to run, and it will do all the work for you.

                The iterator object must have the next() method. This is where the magic happens. You can
                define your own logic here. Iterators must return an object with two properties: value, and done.
                Value is the current value of the thing we are iterating. Done is a bool that indicates if we 
                have completed all iterations. Done should be false until we have finished iteration, then it 
                should be true. Subsequent calls once done will continue to return the same. 
                Once done is true, we no longer care about value, and you should avoid using value at that point.
                Value may be undefined, but this is not enforced by the language.
