    /*
    ES6 Classes - as of 2015 when javascript introduced version 6 we can use class syntax that is
    very simialr to Java syntax. We denote classes with the class keyword and define data and behaviors
    within. We can add things like constructors, which are invoked with the new keyword. We can do class
    inheritance with the extends keyword, which will set up the prototype chain for us when an object
    gets instantiated. There are even static data and behaviors now, which just like Java, means those are
    associated with the class itself, not any one object.
