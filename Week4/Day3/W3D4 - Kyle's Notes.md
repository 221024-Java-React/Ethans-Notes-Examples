# Notes from Kyle's Notes Repo:

I added all of my javascript notes to the notes directory. The following are the particular files we looked at today:
 - [ES6 Classes](./notes/javascript-classes.md)
 - [The DOM](./notes/javascript-dom.md)
 - [Javascript Fundementals](./notes/javascript-fundamentals.md) - closures, scopes, this, and iterating
