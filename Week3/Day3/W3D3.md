# Java OOP Overview

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming, there are four pillars of OOP that you need to know

Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation

Abstaction is hiding the detail of implemenation, while still providing the user access to the functionality

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take many forms

Inheritance is the ability for an object to take on states and behaviors from a parent object

Encapsulation is hiding data, while making it available through mutators.

# Java OOP Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Java used Access Modifers to hide information inside of classes.

We use mutators, which are methods available to every other class to share the states that we want, while hiding the sensitive states that should not be shared

We typically denote these mutators as methods called getters and setter, getters will return the data from hidden variable inside of a class, setters will set the value of a hidden variable inside of a class

# Java OOP Inheritance

Inheritance is were a base class (or parent class) passes traits/behaviors down to a sub-class (or child class)

-   This creates a parent-child or is-a relationship between two classes

In Java all non-private fields and methods are inherited from a parent class by using the keyword extends in the class declaration

Inheritance is useful because:

-   It allows code to be more reusable and modular
-   It helps avoid boilerplate (redundant) code, helping us abide by the common programming guidline DRY (don't repeat yourself)

Shadowing:

-   the practice in Java programming of having two variables with the same name within scopes that overlap
    -   When this happens the higher-level scope is hidden because the variable with lower level scope overrides it
    -   The higher level variable is now shadowed
-   When a parent and child share the same variable, the childs will shadow the parents

In Java there is no multiple inheritance via classes, meaning one class can only ever extend one other class

-   This is because two different classes can have the same method, and the sub class would not know implementation to use

However, classes in Java are allowed to implement any number of interfaces, making multiple inheritance possible through interfaces

-   This is because interfaces don't care what implemenation you give them, as long as the method is implemented in the subclass

# Java OOP Abstraction

Abstraction is a programming principle in which we centralize common characteristics and generalize behavior into conceptual classes

With abstraction you hide the underlying copmlexity through a simplified interface

Essentially hiding how something functions, but still allows users to know what its functions are

In java abstraction is done through abstract classes and interfaces

# Java OOP Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take on many forms

The most common ways this is achieved is:

-   Method overloading
-   Method overriding
-   covariance
-   casting

Method Overloading:

-   Two or more methods exist with the same name, but have different method signatures by changing the parameter list

You can change the number of parameters, the types of the parameters, or the order in which the parameters are passed

-   The return type must stay the same
-   Which method runs is determined at run-time, making it run-time polymorphism

Method Overriding:

-   A method in a child class has the same name as a method in the parent class, but a different implementation

Overriding methods makes class hierarchies more flexible and dynamic

Method overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism because of virtual method invocation

-   Virtual Method Invocation will look at the reference objects type and call the method associated with that object

If a subclass implements the same static method as its parent, the method is hidden. Method hiding replaces the parent method in the calls defined in the child class

Covariant Return Type:

-   When overriding a method you can change the return type as long as it is a subclass of the original return type
-   You can change the access modifier as long as it is not more restrictive

## Casting

Upcasting allows you to assign a child object to a parent object, this works because the child will have all of the behaviors of the parent, however you may be missing some of the childs functionality

Downcasting is the opposite, it allows you to assign a parent object to a child object, however you cannot garentee that the parent object will have all the properties of the child leading to problems

# Time Complexity

Time complexity is the study of how effecient any given algorithm is

There are three popular ways to access the effeciency of an algorithm
- Big O - worst case
- Omega - best case
- Theta - mean case

Typically we want to know what how our application is going to run in its worst case, so Big Oh notation is typically the most popular way of measuring effeciency
- We want to calculate what the highest possible total number of operations our algorithm may have to endure

We denote the number of operations as n
- If our algorithm has to run either 3 time or 10 times, n would then equal 10

Typical Big O notations include:

- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithimic
- O(N): Linear time
- O(n log n): n times Logarithmic
- O(N^n): Exponential

To formally find the "true" Big O of an algorithm, it requires complicated proofs and math, however there is a shortcut to approximate big o
- If the algorithm includes no looping, only branching, it can be considered constant time
- If the algorithm divides and conquers either via recursion or dynamic programming it is most likely logarithmic
- If the algorithm includes a loop that runs n times, the algorithm is most likely linear
- If the algorithm includes nested loops, the algorithm is most likely exponential

# Linear Search

Linear search is the most efficient known algorithm to search an unsorted array

The algormithm starts with a value to search for, and an unsorted array

The algorithm simply loops through every value of the array until it either finds the value that it is looking for, or it doesn't find the value and exits the loop

Using what we learned about Big O notation, we can conclude since this uses a single loop, and no divide and conquer, this algorithm is linear time, or O(n)

Keep in mind, this is not the most efficient algorithm, however, the randomness of the unsorted array makes it impossible to find a faster algorithm (for now).

# Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for searching for an element in a sorted array/list

It is important that the list is already sorted for a binary search to work

The basic algorithm for binary search is a little more complicated than linear search and goes as the following

1.  Pick the midpoint of the list, and check to see if the value is the one you are looking for
2.  If the value is larger than the one you are looking for
    - find the middle of the right half of the array, and check to see if its the value you are looking for
3. If the value is smaller than the one you are looking for
    - find the middle of the left half of the array, and check to see if its the value you are looking for
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you either find the value, or determin that the value doesn't exist

This algorithm can either be done iteratively (with a loop) or recursively (more advanced technique we don't train)

Either implementation is never going to have to iterate through an entire list, rather we continiually split the list in half. Because of this the Big O is O(log n) making it a very effecient algorithm
