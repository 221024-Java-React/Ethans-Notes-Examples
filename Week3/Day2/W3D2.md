## Maps

Data structure that uses key/value pairs to store and retrieve data

The Map interface does not implement the Collection Interface, however it is still considered to be part of the Collections API

You cannot iterate over a Map, because it does not implement the iterable interface, you can iterate through different values in a Map:

-   use the entrySet() method to iterate over the set of Map.entry
-   use keySet() method to iterate over the set of keys
-   use values() method to return a Collection of values which then can be iterated over

HashMap: a concrete implementation of the Maps interface that:

-   Stores elements in a key/value pair
-   Insertion and retreival is fast
-   Tradeoff is that it does not maintain insetion order
-   Permits on null key and null values

TreeMap: a concrete implementation of the Maps interface that:

-   Stores its keys in a sorted tree structure
-   Insertion and retrieval is slow
-   Cannot contain null keys

HashTable: older concrete implementation of the Maps interface that is threadsage, and cannot contain null keys or values

# Java Stacks and Vector

Vector: an older concrete implementation of the List interface, which is a threadsafe arraylist

-   Doubles in size if needed

Stack: an older concrete implementation of the List interface, used to implement the stack data structure, (first in last out), but you should now use ArrayDeque

## Queues

Collection of data that follows first in first out, unless otherwise specified

ArrayDeque: a concrete implementation of the Queue interface that allows programmers to implement stack or queue behavior

-   It is a double ended queue
-   It stores items in a resizable array

Useful ArrayDeque methods:

-   pop()
-   push()
-   peekFirst()
-   peekLast()
-   pollFirst()
-   pollLast()
-   offerFirst()
-   offerLast()

Priority Queue: a concrete implementation of the Queue interface which orders elements based on their natural ordering

-   It uses a Comparator to order the elements

# Comparable and Comparator Interfaces

## Comparable:

an interface which defines the natual ordering for a class

-   The class must implement the Comparabl interface and implement the compareTo() method

The compareTo() method should return:

-   Zero id the two object are equal
-   Less than zero if "this" object is smaller than the one in the parameter list
-   Greater than zero is "this" object is larger than the one in the parameter list

## Comparator

an interface that allows you to define a total ordering on some collection of objects

-   You can implement the Comparator interface, but are not required to implement the .compare() method

# Java 8 Features

Java 8 implemented many new and useful features including

-   Functional Interfaces
-   Lamda Expressions
-   Stream API
-   Reflections API
-   Date and Time API
-   Optional Classes
-   Predicates

# Fuctional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with only one abstract method.
- Implicitly created by lambdas
- Can be explicitly created for use by lambdas

# Lamdas:
possibly the biggest addition to Java 8, they introduce important aspects of functional programming, allow for disembodied methods, aka functions


The basic syntax is `parameter(s) -> expression`

For multiple parameters parenthesis are required, for multiple lines of logic in the expression curly braces are required

The return keyword is optional for single expression lambdas

Lambdas are used a lot in conjunction with forEach loops on collections, and with the Streams API to apply perform some logic before passing data to the next stream

# Date and Time API:

Before Java 8 Dates and Times were separate, represented by java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar, and there were issues with these classes

Java introduced a new APU through the java.time package which includes:

-   LocalDate - only contains date information
-   LocalTime - only contains time information
-   LocalDateTime - contains a date and time
-   ZonedDateTime - for working with time zones
-   Period - represents a quantity of time (years, months, days)
-   Duration - represents quantity of time (seconds, nanoseconds)
-   DateTimeFormatter - for representing dates/times in a given format

## DateTimeFormatter

Provides Static Variables, and other methods to parse and format dates and times in just about everyway imagineable

## Optional Class:

The optional class was introduced to reduce the need for excessive null value checking

An Optional is a wrapper object which may or may not contain a value, with a few helpful helper methods

They are useful as replacements for null values when returning an empty response from a method

Example:

```java
public class OptionalExample {
  public Optional<String> getAmbiguousString(boolean b) {
    if (true) {
	  return Optional.of("awesome string!");
	} else {
	  return Optional.empty();
	}
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Optional<String> optString = getAmbiguousString(false);
	String theString = optString.orElse(""); // specify a fallback value
	System.out.println(theString);
	// we can use the String without fear of NullPointerException now
  }
}
```

# Stream API

The Stream API is a functional-style of defining operations on a stream of elements.

-   Streams are an abstraction which allow defining operations which do not modify the source data, and are lazily loaded

Streams do not store data, they simply operate on data, like filtering, mapping, or reducing it

Streams are divided into two streams:

-   Intermediate, return a new stream and are always lazy, they don't execute until the terminal operation is called
-   Terminal, trigger the execution of the stream pipeline, which allows effiecency by performing all operations in a single pass over the data

Reduction operations take a sequence of elements and combine them into a single result

-   .reduce() and .collect() are implemented by many Stream classes for this purpose

Example:

```java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
// add students...
List<Double> grades = students.stream()
                          .filter(s -> s.isAttending())
						  .mapToDouble(s -> s.getGrade)
						  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```
