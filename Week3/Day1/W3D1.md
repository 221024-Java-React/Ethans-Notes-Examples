# Introduction to Rest

Rest Stands for Representational State Transfer

Is an architectural style that outline communication between client and a server

The outline is a set of guides for developing a webserver

To RESTFul the webservice in question must follow these 6 constraints:

1. Uniform interface: the service must adhere to a commonly decided API standard:
    - Identification of resources: URL
    - Manipulation of resources through representations: a request yields the start of a resource
    - Self descriptive
    - Hypermedia as the engine of application state
2. Client-Server: separation of concerns
3. Stateless: the server should no retain any information about the clients session
4. Cacheable: Responses should be explicitly labeled as cacheable or not
5. Layered System: the system should be separated into layers such that components only interact with components that are part of the same layer
6. Code on Demand: an optional constraint that allows executable code or scripts to be sent with responses

# Exposing and Consuming Restful api endpoints

## Rest concepts resources

Resources in REST are literally any information that the webservice is serving to the client

We typically represent these resources with some standard such as XML or JSON

## Rest naming conventions

To identify resources with a RESTful service we use URL's (Unified Resource Locatator), this is called the recource identifier

RESTful services should have uniform resource identifiers, so here are some rules you can follow to conform to this:

-   use nouns to name resources
-   begin your uri with the plural collection of a particular resource
-   use path parameters to identify single resource in a specific/record
-   capitalize on path structure to represent hierarchy
-   identify store of resources that are managed by the client (sub-collections)
-   use query parameters to filter resources of a particular type
-   be consistant across the board

# Authorization vs Authentication

## Authorization:

Determining the users access level
- When a user is logged in, checking their role to give them permissions

## Authentication:

Verifying that someone is who they say they are
- Having a user log to confirm their identity before showing them any information

# Session Management:

## Cookies

Cookies are key-value pairs of information sent by the server to the client, which the client stores

-   then you send the cookie in the HTTP request header

The servlet can the check for the presence of the cookie, most likely to get session information

There are two types of cookies:

-   Non-persistent: a cookie that expires when the user closes the browser
-   Persistent: a cookie that only expires if the user logs out of the website, it is stored even after the browser is closed

To set up a cookie, you simply use document.cookie = `the cookie`

We need to be careful what we store inside of the cookies, because attackers can use cross site scripting to see the information inside of cookies

Also keep in mind that we can only use cookies on files being hosted by a server

## HTTP Session API

Http Session API is a way to identify a user and store information about them based on their http requests

Sessions also require that you be hosting your static files on a server

You can manage these sessions nicely (kinda) with Javalin

1. You can  use the context from the http handler to create key/value session pairs

    - `context.req.sessionAttribute("key", "value")`

2. You can retrieve these attributes from the session with

    - `context.req.getSession().sessionAttribute("key")`

3. To remove a session attribute/invalidate you use
    - `context.req.getSession().invalidate()`
