# Redux

## Flux Design Pattern:

an application architecture designed by Facebook to combat/work better with Reacts unidirectional data flow
- It is more of a pattern that a framework
- It is a wat of passing information through an application

Flux uses a central "Store" to store the shared application state, uses dispatchers to dispatch actions that change the state of the store, and it uses views to display the data held in the store


## Basic Flux Flow

![flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/overview/flux-simple-f8-diagram-explained-1300w.png)

# Store

manages a collection of objects that represent the application state for a particular domain within the application

An application can have multiple stores, each with its own reponsibility
- They are thought of as somewhat similarly to models in the MVC architecture
- When a store is updated, it can alert components anywhere in the application that are relying on that data to update

# Dispatcher:
the dispatcher is the central hub that manages the flow in a flux application
- it is a function that is called to update information from an action compared to the old information in the store
- it gives the store a new representation of the data to hold

The central Dispatcher can route different actions to the stores across the application
- each store registers itself with the central dispatcher

# Actions:
simple Javascript Object that contains a type of the actions, and any payload of data. These are sent to the dispatcher, and handled in the correct reducers. The way they handled, depends on the type of the action

# Reducers:
functions that calculate the new state of the store based on the previous state and the action provided

# View:
what end users see (components)

# More benefits vs Drawbacks of Flux

## Benefits

Information is held globally:
- No more lifting state
- Particlular data can be subscribed to by components so they are informed when the data is updated
- Avoid prop drilling

Single Source of Truth
- Information is held in a store, and not duplicated across multiple components

Data in the store is immutable
- This makes it easy to compare across updates and test

## Drawbacks of Flux

Can be complicated to implement with multiple levels that need information

Does not work with async logic flows out of the box
- To make async calls the pattern has to be expanded

# Redux

redux is an implementation of the Flux design pattern for Javascript Applications
- it is not built specifically for React, however, there is a library for react
- `npm i redux`

# Redux Libraries and Tools

## React-Redux

The official library for using Redux with React, it has all the connections needed to specifially use redux with React
- `npm i react-redux`

## Redux Toolkit (Perferred Method):

A library of additional support functions that can make using redux easier and conform more to the best practices
- `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit`

Quick start documentation: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start

## Redux DevTools (Optional):

A browser extension that lets you see changes made to your central store over time in the browsers console

# Redux Application Flow:

1. Create a base store for the application to hold all of the central/application state, the store will take in reducers to manipulate the state of the application

2. When the user interacts with the page, and action will be dispatched. The action will be created with a `type` and sometimes with a `payload`, this action gets dispatched by the component

3. The dispatched action gets sent to the store, where it gets deligated to the correct reducer to handle the action

4. Reducer determines how to handle the action based on its type. With Redux toolkit, we will define these reducers in a slice for that particular state
- Reducers should be pure functions, taking in data, and returing the state without any side effects. This mean that the reducer itself, shouldn't make HTTP calls, or do async logic.
- This is does so that the code is predictible. Testing libraries, and Redux Webtools, and other rely on this to ensure that they function properly.

5. The reducer returns the new state, then the state of the store is updated, any component subscribed to the store will be notified and the information on the view is updated

# Thunks

functions that can used instead of object to promise that an objcet will be given at a later time
- allows us to delay the synchronous nature of the flux design pattern while you retrieve information

Thunks are not implemented by default in base redux, and have to be included if you are going to use them

But redux toolkit does include them by default

Promises are built using thunks under the hood, along with additional functionality. The additional functionality causes side effects making promises not applicable for Redux

# Jest

Jest is an open source testing framework designed by facebook for use with React, but it is also functional with other JS frameworks

Jest is popular because:
- it is lightweight compared to other testing frameworks
- has robust test writing capababilities
- mocking capabilities (create fake dependent classes to mock API data/user input)
- snapshots to see each render of a component to ensure you are not rendering something errornous and then immediately rendering
- capable of testing the DOM easily

Jest is the default React testing framework, theres nothing to install

## Unit Testing Functions

Jest provides the functions to setup and evaluate our unit tests including
- `describe('description', callback)` which sets up different test suites
- `it('description' callback)` sets up individual tests inside of a test suite,
    - The callback function will include the logic for the individual tests

To test your code, use the evaulation functions provided by Jest such as
- expect()
- toBe()
- toBeTruthy() / toBeFalsey()

## Mocking

Jest allows you to mock functions, return values, modules

This would allow you to test functions that might rely on others, or make api calls

To mock a function, you use the `jest.fn()` method, then chain the `.mockReturnValueOnce()` method to return some value instead of calling the original method

You can also use `jest.spyOn()` method to watch method calls
- With spyOn you are able to use the original implementation of the method or mock the implemenation


To mock an entire module you use the `jest.mock()` method, this allows you to provide a mock implementation to all the functions in a module rather than choosing specific methods

# React Testing Library

React testing library is reacts alternative to enzyme, and the new official way to render react components for testing

It allows developers to see inside of their component after specific moments to test the states and behaviors are as expected

Use the render() function from the library to render the component you are testing

It is also used to select elements from the component to test to be sure they are accurate
