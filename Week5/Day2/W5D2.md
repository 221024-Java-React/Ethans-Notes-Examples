# Functional Components in React

React allows you to create components based off of functions
- These are simplier, and more straight forward to write
- With the inclusion of Hooks, functional components are now (almost) as powerful as more bulky class based components
- The only thing with funcion based components, is that they must return JSX/TSX

## Hooks

built in functions that allow us to "hook" into React state and lifecycle methods from functional components

This gave function components the same amount of power as class based

## Basic Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer

useState:
- allows you to store and mutate state inside of a function component
- declare a state variable and a mutator inside of square brackets, then use the `useState(defaultVal)` to set the state orginally
    - `const [state, setState] = useState("")`
- use the declared mutator to change and update the state
- with useState, the state does not have to be an object like it does in classes

useEffect:
- allows you to perform some logic at a specific point in the applications life
- its takes in a callback function that performs logic
- it can be used to watch for specific events/changes in state to perform some logic
- If you only want it to run once at the beginning of the components life, you can give it an empty array
- You can watch specific state members, by adding them to the array

useContext:
- used to access values being stored in the ContextAPI
- Context is a way to store application state

useReducer:
- used as an advanced in component state manager, could also be used in conjunction with the Context API
- Instead of storing just a state value, it also takes in a reducer function, which describes how the states data should be modified

# Event Handling in React

Event handing in React is similar to HTML, however, with JSX you must use camelCase for the event name, and pass the handler as a JS reference rather than a string

## Synthetic Events
cross browser wrapper around browsers native event, this is used when an event occurs in React

Used because it is capable of pooling, which means the SyntheticEvent Objects are reused to improve performance, however, issues can arise because after the callback is called the properties are nullified

# React Conditional Rendering

In React we can decide if/when components should be displayed with conditional rendering

You will typically see conditional rendering looking at some state of a parent component, and either Render the child component or render nothing using a ternary operator

# Mapping Elements from a list

If you want to render a list of elements in React, it is typically done with the `.map()` function on the array object

However, React expects you to prive a unique key for each element that you are mapping through
- This helps React identify which items have been changed, added, or removed

The only time you should use an index (of the array) as a key, is when you have no other options

# Events, Conditional, and Mapping Demo

# Routing

allows users to have the experience of navigating through different pages while actually staying on the same SPA page

React can swap our views with different URL paths
- React is not actually a SPA by default, however, but using React Router you can make it one

## React Router and React Router DOM

React Router is a declaritive model navigational components within your application

React Router DOM provides several solutions for reacting a router in your application depending on the relationship you want your UI to have with your URL

## BrowserRouter:
uses HTML history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL
- Wrap THE `BrowserRouter` tag around `Routes` tags, where each Route represents a renderable component
- The component to be rendered is nested inside of the `Route` tag
- The `Route` tag is used to ensure that each component is rendered exclusively per route

Install react-router-dom with `npm i react-router-dom`

# React - AJAX Requests

To create requests to a backend service, we can either use fetch or Axios

## Axios

a promise based HTTP client for browsers or NodeJS

It is supported by most modern browsers, and comes with the following features
- Intercepting and transforming request and response data
- Automatically parses JSON response data
- Canceling of requests
- Better error handling
- Built in protection vs cross site request forgery

## Axios vs Fetch

Fetch is tied to the window object, which doesn't make sense in a server environment like NodeJS

Axios works more cleanly from the server side

Axios will automatically stringify and parse request bodies and response bodies to and from JSON

Axios can cancel, timeout, or interupt HTTP requests before they are finished, fetch cannot

Ultimately it is up to you to choose what you would like to use with React

To install axios for use in our React application: `npm i axios`

# React Application State Management

React has an Application State Management problem, all data can only flow one way, so sharing state between multiple components can become tricky

There are a few possible solutions for this problem:

1. Lifting State: we have already seen this is usable, however it becomes complicated quickly

2. React Context API: a built in centralized data store that comes with React

3. Use the Flux Design Pattern through React Redux

## Lifting State

As previously mentioned, data can only flow one way in React, and props are read only, so we cannot change the state of a parent class from a child class

However, we can "Lift State" by passing a child component a funciton as a prop, that changes the state of the parent component

Lifting state is useful when a common parent/ancestor is shared across multiple other components that are sharing common values

There are limitations when applications become too large and the entire application needs to keep track of the state, it becomes difficult to manage. However, we will soon learn of a technology to handle this for us

# React useContext vs Redux

## useContext

The Context API is Reacts built in state management system. It was created to combat the one direction dataflow of react, and help aliviate prop drilling.

"Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level" - React Docs

Context allows you to setup a global "context" aka state that is shared through some provider component
- Wrap all the components which need the context in the provider

Typically developers create separate files for different contexts, to setup a context you will use the `React.createContext(state)` method

The object you store this context in will be exported.
- You can also make use of other hooks in your context file such as useState and useReducer to create more complex state mangement

To use the context you must wrap the components which need the context inside of the Provider component which is provided for you when your create your context with the `React.createContext` method

```jsx
<Context.Provider>
    <ComponentOne></ComponentOne>
    <ComponentTwo></ComponentTwo>
    .
    .
    .
</Context.Provider>
```

Optionally, you can include the `value` prop in the provider to pass the Context some value other than the default you may have provided

To consume the context from the provider you will need to use the `useContext(context)` hook provided by React

Now instead of passing props through multiple levels, you can just bring in that global state from the provider, hopefully making your application less confusing.

For smaller applications the use of Context API with useState/useReducer is good enough for state management, however for larger more complicated applications developers might opt for the Flux design pattern and Redux
